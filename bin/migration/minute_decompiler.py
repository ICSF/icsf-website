# This file contained some experiments on decompiling minutes from the html on the website to the .min format. The experiments were never finished, as I discovered I could just pop the .html files from the server into the repo with minor changes.

# This file is designed to run as a Jupyter Notebook through [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext), but _may_ also probably work as a normal Python file (with some changes).
