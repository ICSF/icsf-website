							</a>
						</div>
						<p>Born in England in 1943, Ian Watson became a full time writer in 1976 after working in academia,
							which  included lectureships in Literature and Future Studies.  His first novel was <i>The Embedding</i> (1973), which won the John W. Campbell
							Memorial Award and is an acknowledged classic of Science Fiction.  He has since written
							numerous SF, Fantasy and Horror novels including <i>Miracle Visitors</i> and <i>Deathhunter</i>;
							several of which have been finalists for the Hugo and Nebula awards.   He was also a
							guest of honour at Picocon 17 so we are pleased to have him back! </p>

						</div>

						<p>Natasha Mostert is South African, although she currently lives in London.    Her debut novel,
							<i>The Midnight Side</i>, a story of obsessive love and a ghost manipulating the London Stock exchange,
							was first published in 2002.  Since then she has published two further novels - <i>The Other Side of
								Silence</i> and <i>Windwalker</i>.   She has also written political opinion pieces in <i>The New York Times</i>
							and <i>Newsweek.</i> Natasha states one of her future goals to be
							"coming face to face with a ghost" - and although we can't promise that (at least, we hope not!),
							we do wish her a warm welcome to Picocon 23. </p>

						<p>Mark Roberts is an accomplished writer and illustrator, and his work has appeared in titles such as
							<i>The New York Review of SF</i> and many others.  He is best known
							for his co-editorship with Jeff VanderMeer of the <i>The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to
								Eccentric & Discredited Diseases,</i>
							first published in 2003.  The book was a finalist for the Hugo Award and the World Fantasy Award
							and contains contributions from over 60 authors on various concocted diseases - some slightly
							improbable, others wildly imagined.  We look forward to an interesting discussion during his
							talk at Picocon. </p>

			<h3>&nbsp;After the Event</h3>


			<p>
				Apart from South Kensington station being on fire (only a small fire), which
				cause a little early morning panic, nothing went drastically wrong. If a fish
				duel had happened, Imperial would have beaten the champion from Cambridge, and
				Oxford would not have sent a representative.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise was a particular success - raising a
				phenomenal £262.92 for RAG, the 8th largest sum in the whole college. Both Jar
				Jar Binks and William Shatner's narration of Mysteries of the Gods went for £70
				each, a society record. The money went to the National Library for the Blind.
