						<p>Born in England in 1943, Ian Watson became a full time writer in 1976 after working in academia,
							which  included lectureships in Literature and Future Studies.  His first novel was <i>The Embedding</i> (1973), which won the John W. Campbell
							Memorial Award and is an acknowledged classic of Science Fiction.  He has since written
							numerous SF, Fantasy and Horror novels including <i>Miracle Visitors</i> and <i>Deathhunter</i>;
							several of which have been finalists for the Hugo and Nebula awards.   He was also a
							guest of honour at Picocon 17 so we are pleased to have him back! </p>

						<p>Natasha Mostert is South African, although she currently lives in London.    Her debut novel,
							<i>The Midnight Side</i>, a story of obsessive love and a ghost manipulating the London Stock exchange,
							was first published in 2002.  Since then she has published two further novels - <i>The Other Side of
								Silence</i> and <i>Windwalker</i>.   She has also written political opinion pieces in <i>The New York Times</i>
							and </i>Newsweek.</i> Natasha states one of her future goals to be
							"coming face to face with a ghost" - and although we can't promise that (at least, we hope not!),
							we do wish her a warm welcome to Picocon 23. </p>

						<p>Mark Roberts is an accomplished writer and illustrator, and his work has appeared in titles such as

								Eccentric & Discredited Diseases,</i>
							first published in 2003.  The book was a finalist for the Hugo Award and the World Fantasy Award
							and contains contributions from over 60 authors on various concocted diseases - some slightly
							improbable, others wildly imagined.  We look forward to an interesting discussion during his
							talk at Picocon. </p>

			<h3 class="bodyLight3">&nbsp;Directions to Picocon</h3>


			<p>Here's a general <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=526570&y=179485&z=1" target="_top">map</a> of the area, pointing at the entrance to Beit Quad (which houses the Union) off Prince Consort Road.</p>

			<p>The easiest way to get to Picocon is by tube; both Gloucester Road Station and South Kensington Station are within easy reach. The following TfL maps are accurate enough, as long as you ignore the place names: from <a href="../../../library/history/resources/gloucester_road.pdf" target="_blank">Gloucester Road Station</a> and from <a href="../../../library/history/resources/south_kensington.pdf" target="_blank">South Kensington Station</a>.</p>

			<p>The buses C1, 9, 10, 49, 52, 70, 74, 345, 360 and 414 all stop nearby. Please look <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses/buses_map.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> for further information from TfL - in particular the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses/spiders/pdf/south-kensington.pdf" target="_blank">South Kensington spider map</a> may be helpful.</p>

			<h3 class="bodyLight3">&nbsp;After the Event</h3>


			<p>
				Apart from South Kensington station being on fire (only a small fire), which
				cause a little early morning panic, nothing went drastically wrong. If a fish
				duel had happened, Imperial would have beaten the champion from Cambridge, and
				Oxford would not have sent a representative.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise was a particular success - raising a
				phenomenal £262.92 for RAG, the 8th largest sum in the whole college. Both Jar
				Jar Binks and William Shatner's narration of Mysteries of the Gods went for £70
				each, a society record. The money went to the National Library for the Blind.
