			<h2>Picocon 24</h2>


			<p>Picocon 24 took place on <b>Saturday 17th February 2007</b> at Imperial College Students Union on Prince Consort Road in South Kensington, London.<br />
					&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Picocon 24 was a very sucessful convention, raising a great deal of money for both the society and RAG - of particular note was the bidding war during
				the Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise, which saw 'The Spot' (a respray of a spiderman figue) sold for an absolutely incredible amount of money.   </p>

						<p>Born in Leeds, England, Charles knew he wanted to be a science fiction writer from the age of six. He made his first professional sale, the short story 'The Boys' to Interzone in 1986. He began writing fiction in earnest again in 1998, including titles such as the singularitypunk 'Accelerando', the cross-genre Lovecraftian SF spy thriller 'The Atrocity Archive', and the acclaimed space opera 'Singularity Sky' and its sequel 'Iron Sunrise'.</p>
