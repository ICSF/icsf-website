			<h3>Picocon</h3>

			<p>
				Tomorrow, Saturday 9 March in the Bot Zoo Common Room, IC SF
				Soc brings you our very own science fiction convention - PICOCON.
				Starting at 10.00am and continuing to 10.00pm (at least),
				PICOCON will give you the chance to sample the best in
				science fiction.
				There will be a host of video films, two guest speakers,
				games demonstrations and more.
			</p>

			<p>The Days timetable is:-
				<br /><b>10.00am</b> Registration
				<br /><b>10.15am</b> Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl
				<br /><b>11.45am</b> Charades Game - SFSOC vs ASTROSOC
				<br /><b>12.15pm</b> Lunch and Treasure Trap demonstration
				<br /><b>1.00pm</b> Star Wars
				<br /><b>3.00pm</b> First Speaker Gerry Web
				<br /><b>4.00pm</b> Empire Strikes Back
				<br /><b>6.00pm</b> Second Speaker - Dave Langford
				<br /><b>7.00pm</b> Blade Runner
				<br /><b>9.00pm</b> Dreamscape
				<br /><b>10.30pm</b> Close of convention
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout the convention we will have two computers running
				games such as the award-winning ELITE by Acornsoft.
				Refreshments will also be available all day.
			</p>

			<p>Now for a bit of data on our speakers:</p>

			<p>
				Gerry Web is a long standing member of the British
				Interplanetary Society, a group spearheaded by Arthur C Clarke
				in the 30's and 40's.
				Gerry has worked on the Daedalus Project and now runs a firm
				of space science consultants. He is also a longstanding fan
				of science fiction.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dave Langford is also a long time fan of SF, and is now a
				full time writer. The Critical Mass column in White Dwarf
				magazine is his most well known face, but he has also written
				The Space Eater, War in 2080 and The Leaky Establishment,
				in which he drew on his experiences of work at Aldermarston.
				Dave's talk last year was so entertaining that we've asked
				him back for more.
			</p>

			<p>
				So there it is PICOCON PI, 12 hours of science fiction
				experiences all for only &pound;2.50.
				What more could you ask for?
			</p>

			<h2>Science Fiction</h2>

			<p style="font-weight: bold;">
				The Imperial Stormtroopers were closing in, their blaster fire
				getting closer to the base. It was time to leave. Han Solo
				lifted his gun and shouted, "Move it out".
				The Rebel group leapt from cover and raked the oncoming troops
				with fire. Han's gun spat deadly laser bolts. He hit two
				troopers full in the chest and they went down. Two nearby
				Rebels were split asunder by the heavy callibre fire of the
				Imperials. It was time to get out of there.'.
			</p>

			<p>
				That is how many people encounter science fiction, in the form
				of the special effects extravaganzas of the cinema. Recent films
				like the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, <i>Buck Rogers</i> and
				television shows like <i>Dr Who</i> and <i>Space 1999</i> are
				indeed what most people think science fiction is all about -
				flashy hardware, cardboard characters, thin plots but lots of
				mindless simplistic action to make up for it. Oh, and superb,
				expensive special effects. Most SF films and TV series are in
				fact like this, and all of them are pretty crap.
			</p>

			<p>
				The home of science fiction, however, is not the screen but the
				printed page, and the screen version of SF, despite a few
				notable exceptions, lags about 50 years behind the books.
			</p>

			<p>
				Science fiction first came into its own in the magazines of the
				twenties and thirties with such titles as <i>Amazing Science
				Fiction</i>. These featured mainly the whizz-bang-zap kind of
				science fiction common in today's cinema. - This was neither
				scientific nor particularly good fiction, but did introduce a
				lot of people to the idea of setting stories in either the
				future, or alternative worlds. Three noted, and possibly
				infamous, stars of this period were E E 'Doc' Smith, Robert E
				Howard and L Ron Hubbard. Smith's horrifyingly awful Skylark
				and Lensman series are still staple fodder for many young SF fans,
				all of whom later complain how bad his stories are.
				Howard too will never be forgotten, nor forgiven, for his
				creation Conan the Barbarian, who has recently stepped in to the
				cinema in some pretty dire films. Hubbard though went from
				writing awful science fiction to founding the pretty awful
				religion of Scientology. He then died and is now more or
				less forgotton (thank God!).
			</p>

			<p>
				However during this period, known to many SF fans as the Golden
				Age, some authors started to use science fiction in a more
				grown up way. Two distinct schools grew up, which have now
				become respectively known as hard and soft science fiction.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first of these to arise was hard SF. Its founding fathers
				were Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein and to a lesser extent,
				Arthur C Clarke. The basic idea behind hard science fiction
				is science. The hard authors usually take a few interesting
				scientific ideas, like machines that think or black holes,
				and see where this takes them. The usual source of ideas for
				hard SF is hard science, like physics or astronomy. In this
				sort of work, the people in the stories are usually secondary
				to the ideas, and so characterisations are sometimes rather
				wooden. Hard science fiction writers are often scientists
				themselves. Robert Forward, a physicist at Bell Labs, in fact
				published a paper on a device he worked out for use in his
				books Dragon's Egg. Hard science fiction ruled supreme
				throughout the late 40's and 50's with such classics as
				Asimov's <em>Foundation</em> trilogy and Heinlein's
				<i>Starship Troopers</i>.

			<p>
				With the 60's however, change come in the form of the English
				authors Brian Aldiss, J G Ballard and Michael Moorcock.
				They came from a literary rather than a scientific background,
				and concentrated on the more human aspects of the world.
				Where science was involved at all it was generally ecology or
				psychology. The advent of these, and other, authors created
				soft science fiction, more usually termed New Wave. The
				spearhead of the New Wave in the late 60's was the magazine
				New Worlds, edited by Michael Moorcock. This and the whole of
				the New Wave was dominated by the attitudes of the hippy
				culture of the time, and concentrated on such themes as
				mind-changing drugs, anti-war protests, eastern religions and
				ecology. Most of the New Wave soft SF is set in the near
				future as opposed to the vast time scales frequently involved
				in hard SF. The New Wave also served to vastly increase the
				literary quality of science fiction, and encouraged
				experimentation in style. Occasional disasters came as a result
				of this, such as the nearly unreadable <i>Barefoot In 
				The Head</i> by Brian Aldiss. However, this experimentation
				also lead to the breakdown of the barriers between hard and
				soft SF and between SF and the rest of mainstream fiction.
				As a result of this certain of the New Wave authors are now
				among the most acclaimed of modern writers. Indeed J G Ballard
				nearly won last year's Booker prize.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the two decades since the New Wave, science fiction has
				settled down again, with the soft and hard merging into a
				homogenous whole. It may be that the time is ripe for a new
				revolution in style, since many authors have taken to rehashing
				old ideas in the form of long, immensely tedious series.
				Frank Herbert, who first added hard and soft SF to get the
				fabulous <i>Dune</i>, has fallen foul of this sequel disease.
				The sixth Dune book has just been published and a seventh is
				on its way. The signs are bright though, with new authors such
				as Bill Gibson (in his book Neuromancer) returning to the
				originality that distinguishes the best in science fiction.
