				<b>John Salmon</b> presided over this Picocon which was held
				in the Biology Seminar rooms. Apparently ICSF beat Cambridge in
				the quiz, <em>Dangermouse</em> episodes, <em>Scanners</em> and
				<em>The Hunger</em> were all shown and <b>John Brunner</b> and
				<b>Dave Hardy</b> were the special guests.</p>

			<p>
				<em>From Felix, Friday February 20th 1987...</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Picocon is the event of the year, it's the convention of the
				Science Fiction Society of Imperial College. As the name
				suggests it is a small convention and it lasts for only twelve
				hours but during this time there will be speakers, videos,
				quizzes, games, RPGs and slide shows.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is the fifth Picocon held at Imperial College. Over the
				past years we have had many top quality speakers including, for
				example, <b>Dave Langford</b> and <b>Brian Stableford</b>. This
				year our guests of honour are author <b>John Brunner</b> and
				space artist <b>Dave Hardy</b>. Both men are British and are
				highly esteemed in their separate fields of work (which are
				generally dominated by Americans).
			</p>

			<p>
				John Brunner has written several books, mostly science
				fiction and has won several awards including the prestigious
				Hugo award for <em>Stand on Zanzibar</em> (1968) and the Nebula
				award for <em>The Sheep Look Up</em> (1972). He has written
				professionally for over thirty years and has contributed much to
				both the intellectual and lighter sides of science fiction. His
				stalk should be very entertaining and provoke much
				discussion.
			</p>

			<p>
				Britain has produced a few talented science fiction artists.
				One of the latest and most noted artists is David Hardy. Along
				with <b>Patrick Moore</b>, he wrote <em>Challenge of the
				Stars</em> which he illustrated using a vivid sense of
				imagination and scientific accuracy. As well as speaking about
				science fiction art in general, Mr Hardy will also be giving a
				colourful slideshow.
			</p>

			<p>
				As well as our guests of honour, we have invited many other
				authors, science fiction and fantasy buffs who should be popping
				in from the real world (or unreal world as the case may be).
				After mingling with the 'rich and infamous' (no I don't mean the
				WellSoc and Consoc committee members), you could join in with
				the fantasy  and wargames. Hopefully, we should be running Car
				Wars or Paranoia and other role playing games.
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout the day, various video films will be shown. These
				will include <em>Dark Star</em>, <em>The Hunger</em> and
				<em>Scanners</em> (especially for all you bloodthirsty
				non-vegetarians). Last year, the ICSF challenged the Cambridge
				Science Fiction Society to a trial of charades and hack
				questions, we thrashed them in one game and narrowly lost
				another. This year our superconductivity - HAL - computer like
				team intend to demonstrate their superiority with style, so come
				along and give them your support.
			</p>

			<p>
				Refreshments can be bought and will include drinks,
				sandwiches and pizzas.
			</p>

			<p>
				You don't have to be a science fiction or fantasy hack to
				come to attend Picocon, The convention starts at 10am and
				finishes at 10.00pm on Saturday February 21st, and is held in
				the Biology Seminar rooms (old Bot-Zoo common rooms) in Beit
				Arch. Entrance will be &pound;2.50 non members and &pound;2 for
				members.
