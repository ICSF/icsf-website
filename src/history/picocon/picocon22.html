			<h3>&nbsp;Directions to Picocon</h3>

			<p>Picocon 22 will be held at the Imperial College Students Union on Prince Consort Road in South Kensington, London.</p>

			<p>Here's a general <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=526570&y=179485&z=1" target="_blank">map</a> of the area, pointing at the Union.</p>

			<p>South Kensington Station (Piccadilly Line) is within easy reach. Note that the District and Circle lines are not running that weekend, so you may need to find alternative routes! The following TfL map is accurate enough, as long as you ignore the place names: from <a href="picocon22/south_kensington.pdf" target="_blank">South Kensington Station</a>. </p>

			<p>The buses C1, 9, 10, 49, 52, 70, 74, 345, 360 and 414 all stop nearby. Please look <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses/buses_map.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> for further information from TfL - in particular the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses/spiders/pdf/southkensington.pdf" target="_blank">South Kensington spider map</a> may be helpful.</p>
