			<h2>Picocon 18 - Richard's Dalek Racing</h2>

			<img src="images/01_readygetset.jpg" width="250" height="189" alt="lets go!" border="1" align="right" />

			<p class="flavour">...as the thick fog rolled away to reveal the drab Grey streets of London Two
				infamous competitors trundled forwards to take their places in the most
				surreal event of the season.  Norfolk looked at Chance and Chance looked
				back at Norfolk once allies these two blobs of hate in polycarbide armour
				would now face each other in the most fearsome of all trials!  The Picocon
				18 Dalek Racing...</p>

			<p>Racing at breathtaking speeds around fragile containers of highly corrosive
				and suspiciously blue liquid these two would have to use all the cunning
				and guile they possessed if they were to survive the day intact.</p>

			<p>Things started badly for Chance most of the custom tri point undercarriage,
				dual steering broke in several interesting and entertaining and unfixable
				ways minutes before the start of the competition.  However rescue was at
				hand in the form of a rapid refit and a transplanted local automotive
				device was inserted, to great effect if a lot less stability.  Norfolk's
				day began better with steering and drive intact things were going well but
				from the outset it was apparent that reliability was going to be a factor
				in the performance of this classic shaped drone.  In the first test run the
				drive belt (elastic band) snapped and had to be replaced, this set a tend
				for the rest of the day.</p>

			<p>The curse consisted of a long fast straight from the start line, to a sharp
				left-hander and then round a hairpin, a sharp right turn and back down the
				straight to the finish.  This was bordered by bollards, which if knocked
				over would cot the racers a five second time penalty.</p>

			<p>Chance and his new drive worked well but his elevated centre of gravity
				meant that he was prone to overbalancing and toppling when accelerating,
				and breaking, and cornering, and reversing, and going at any speed at
				all.  This would prove to be a handicap that would cost many drivers a lot
				of time.  However compared to the rest of the field his reliability and
				turning circle were excellent and his top speed nicely constant.</p>

			<p>Norfolk's problems began as has been said already from the word go.  The
				unreliable drive system was actually faster than Chances however it
				frequently let go completely and sometimes partially jammed one of the
				steering wheels which made it turn corners rather unexpectedly and
				generally terminally.  This being so it was a lot more stable than Chance
				and didn't fall over once, although the wheels fell off several times.</p>

			<p>Over all Chance was agreed to be the better of the two beating Norfolk on
				all but one occasion, when Norfolk miraculously failed to go wrong and
				romped to victory.  The daleks were very dependent on the quality of the
				drivers and a gentle touch was required at all time, leading to some truly
				hilarious moments.   Over all a good day was had by everyone, the fastest
				time was taken by Ian and the second fastest was taken by Viv.  Well done
				all and thanks to everyone who took part.</p>
