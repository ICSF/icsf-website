<p class="historyTitle">Picocon 7 - 1989</p>

<p>The guests for this Picocon were <b>Dave Langford</b>, <b>Terry Pratchett</b>, <b>Gerry Webb</b> and <b>Dave Lally</b>.... according to one source. According to the Felix article, it was <b>Bob Shaw</b> not <b>Gerry Webb</b>. Ah well. According to <b>Simon Bradshaw</b> "It went wrong. Actually it probably went ok, but owing to various hassles it was a big panic behind the scenes." (sounds familiar)</p>

<p>There was also a talk from the Amateur Rocketry Group, wargaming (Paranoia and Space:1889) and videos all day.</p>
