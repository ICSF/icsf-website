			<p><b>Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise</b> - This now annual event consists of an auction for pieces of offensively tacky, cheap or cute merchandise. All proceeds from the auction go to <a href="http://www2.union.ic.ac.uk/presidents/rag" target="new">icu RAG</a> and the winner of each lot gets to destroy it using the tools available, including large hammers and liquid nitrogen. Please feel free to bring along your own contributions.</p>

			<p><b>Killer tournament</b> - a sort of roleplay running throughout the day. Participants will be issued a target to kill and there will be a prize for the person who kills the most targets. If you would like to bring a weapon along please note that anything dangerous or any form of water pistol will not be allowed. The rules can be found <a href="picocon19/killer.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p><b>LAN Network</b> - We will be running a LAN Network with approximately 10 pcs running a deathmatch games including <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/" target="new">Unreal Tournament</a>. Come along and blow your friends up with high power weaponry.</p>

			<p><b>Dalek Racing</b> - Norfolk and Chance will hopefully be racing again, our daleks go pretty fast, but aren't very good at cornering, making the events less of a race and more a survival contest.</p>

			<p><b>Pitch Black</b> - The day concludes with a showing of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0134847" target="new">Pitch Black</a> in the <a href="http://www2.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/cinema/" target="new">ICU cinema</a>.
