			<h3>Guests of Honour</h3>

			<h4>Alastair Reynolds</h4>
			<!--<img width="200px" height="150px" src="alastair-reynolds.jpg" alt=""/>-->
			<p>
				Alastair Reynolds, born 1966 is most famous for the 5 novels
				and multitude of short stories from the <i>Revelation Space</i> universe.
				However, this is not the sole setting which he uses;
				there are other, stand-alone novels, including a new one due
				for publication in March 2010, Terminal World, self-described
				as "SF, it's weird, and it doesn't have spaceships".
			</p>
			<p>
				Alastair can be found online at

			<h4>Amanda Hemingway</h4>
			<!--<img width="200px" height="150px" src="amanda-hemmingway.jpg" alt=""/>-->
			<p>
				Amanda Hemingway, aka Jemma Harvey, aka Jan Siegal,
				born 1955 is a Writer.
				She prefers 'writer' to author: no-one knows why,
				especially not herself!
				The dry wit running through her fantasy works is a wonderful
				accompaniment to the suspense and imagination inherent in them.
				Her latest works, the Sangreal series, makes good use of a
				combination of very dark elements; time travel and alternate
				universes combine as the Writer explores worlds,
				people and sacrifice, provoking and intriguing her characters
				and readers alike.

			<h4>Jaine Fenn</h4>
			<!--<img width="200px" height="150px" src="jaine-fenn.jpg" alt=""/>-->
			<p>
				Jaine Fenn was born.
				She then grew up and (after a lot of trying) became an author,
				with two novels many short stories in print.
				In terms of her work, there's a great deal more to say&mdash;
				but I wouldn't want to spoil things for you.
				Suffice to say that they are set seven thousand years in the future,
				humanity's greatest enemy may be closer to home than it thinks
				and nothing is as it first appears.
				"Principles of Angels" left me gripped from start to finish and
				"Consorts of Heaven" is, if anything, better.

			<h3>New Ventures</h3>
			<p>This year, a few new things were tried out at Picocon.<br />

Contact with publishers regarding books for sale at this signing lead to Picocon 3<sup>3</sup> selling the very first copies of the British Edition of Alistar Reynold's "<i>Terminal World</i>", roughly two weeks ahead of public release.</p>
