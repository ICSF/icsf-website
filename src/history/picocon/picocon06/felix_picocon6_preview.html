				No one, including the Oxford English Dictionary, seems sure
				whether the concept of 'relief from relief' exists. However,
				after twenty-four hours of solid, unmitigated comic relief ICSF,
				in conjunction with the Medical Research Council and the OED are
				undertaking research into just such a field: Comic Relief
				Reliefoscopy. This glorious piece of world-shattering original
				research will be taking place at Imperial College, yea, even in
				our very own Union Building. Furthermore we require members of
				the general twinkling public to help us with our research, and
				this means you! Yes, you can be part of this journey into the
				unknown for a very paltry (tax-deductable) donation to research
				funds. Members of ICSF, you may attend for only &pound;2.50, but
				even the rest of you need only donate &pound;3 for a whole day
				working alongside our research teams, and your very own slightly
				handcrafted badge as a souvenir.
			</p>

			<p>
				The leaders of the research teams will be personally addressing
				the audience on their own specialist fields during the day.
				Professor Terry Pratchett, author of the classic texts on the
				subject, <em>The Colour of Magic</em>, <em>The Light
				Fantastic</em> and <em>Equal Rites</em> (the last dealing with
				most of the mathematics) and his more recently published work
				<em>Mort</em>, will be addressing the audience at about 2pm and
				Dr Mike Scott Rohan, author of two published works into extremes
				of temperature, <em>Run to the Stars</em> and <em>The Anvil of
				Ice</em> may do likewise at about 5.30pm. In addition,
				background material will be on display throughout the day.
