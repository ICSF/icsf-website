<h3>1.0 Minutes</h3>
Minutes of the last meeting passed with no objections

<h3>1.5 Matters Arising</h3>
Everything happened<br />
Tom to be more verbose<br />

<h3>2.0 Chair's Business</h3>
The chair had no business

<h3>3.0 Treasurer's Report</h3>
We got 60 members of which 56 are real<br />
We got £1230 in refundables<br />
<i>Something about £130 here, but the chair was taking minutes at this point and I can't read what he wrote</i><br />
<i>I think it might mean Copyright Materials</i><br />
Simon says spend money<br />
<i>Tom arrived and took over minute taking</i><br />
Stuff to buy - VCR; Tom will get this<br />

<h3>4.0 Library</h3>
When checking out books, check the databse notes for the member<br />
Don't let people check out books if they haven't given Union Card number
<p>We have more books!</p>
<p>The dark is rising is over there</p>

<h3>5.0 Picocon</h3>
Union provisionaly booked for 7 Feb
<br />Eemeli not to do what the union tell him
<br />Concert hall booked seperatley
<br />Jo sent Eemeli many details but in MS Outlook format which he can't read yet
<br />Film - Paycheck, Kill Bill 2 preview (not gonna happen), ROTK (unavailable 'till Apr), Revolutions (union showng a few weeks before)
<br />Unless we can get something cheap or a big new film, possibly not having one
<br />
<br />Picocon pre-pre-planning meeting to be scheduled
<br />Start publicising once guests confirmed
<br />Possible GoHs - Peter F Hamilton, John C Grimwood
<br />Also to be asked - Jane Johnson and M John Harrison (together make Gabriel King)
<p> That's enough Cthulhus</p>
There was a book fair last month that Picocon organisers should try to go to in future years
<br />Ticket prices need deciding (last year £8, £5, £2)
<br />£8 is too high
<br />Voucher in Felix is a good idea
<br />Presell tickets in Library
<br />
<br />Other contacts - Dave Laley (owner of obscure videos), Dave Clements, check database of doom
<br />Eemeli to go to other cons using society budget
<br />Robbie wants to go too
<br />Simon said absolutley nothing at this point

<h3>5.5 Robbie's Novel</h3>
<i>This was a last minute addition to the agenda inserted due to popular demand</i>
<br />Robbie was unwilling to discus his novel

<h3>6.0 AOB</h3>
Content needed for Wyrm
<br />Every committee member to submit a short book review
<br />Baz to look at shrinking the margins in Wyrm
<br />Competition - more generic picture needed
