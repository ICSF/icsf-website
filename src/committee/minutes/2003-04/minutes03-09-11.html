<p><b>1. Minutes </b><br />
Nobody had a copy of the minutes of the previous meeting</p>

<p><b>2. Freshers' Fair </b><br />
Tues 7 Oct - we presume<br />
Our stall may have to be on the college site rather than at the union as we
had hoped.<br />
We have a large number of spare books that can be given away<br />
We will need enough people to cover both the stall and the library<br />
These people most be bouncy, welcoming etc<br />
Also needed: sign up sheets, info leaflets, posters, fanzine, freshers'
wyrmtongue</p>

<p><b>2.5 Freshers' Wyrmtongue</b><br />
No content yet<br />
Pieces needed from: Chair, Librarians, Vice<br />
Artwork can be scrounged from the archives<br />
Intro to website and mailing lists<br />
Arty / Info stuff in remaining space</p>

<p><b>3. Femtocon</b><br />
Date - provisionally Wed 15 Oct<br />
Give away more books<br />
Quiz - easier than last Picocon due to lower facial hair count; novel format<br />
Food - in back of hall so people have to walk past everything else<br />
LAN if possible - Karne to put a call out for computer specs<br />
Video - something that can be watched for a random few minutes - probably<br />
Monty Python<br />
Xbox<br />
More sign up forms</p>

<p><b>5. Publicity and Posters</b><br />
Standardise society name and logo on all publicity<br />
Use URL everywhere - www.icsf.org.uk<br />
Paper bookmarks with URL on inside books given away at freshers' events</p>

<p><b>6. Library</b><br />
MIT sci-fi society have a huge collection and are interested in swapping
spare books with us. This will probably mean us going to buy books more
readily available in UK to send there.<br />
Video showings - post an advanced schedule somewhere; possibly acquire a
whiteboard<br />
Have rigid schedule for the start of term<br />
More evening showings, especially on Monday and Wednesdays eg. Ultraviolet
Taken, 10th Kingdom<br />
Monday lunch - reshow previous Monday's evening episode(s)<br />
Friday evenings - films you should have seen etc due to less reliable
fresher count<br />
Weekdays - everybody out of library by 14:00 except for Wednesdays<br />
Weekends - 1/2 season Babylon 5 marathons<br />
Some nibbles to be provided for longer video showings</p>

<p><b>7. Events</b><br />
We have a conferences/competitions budget which could be used to send
members to conferences or conventions, or for more regular Wyrmtongue
competitions<br />
Thursday evenings to be dedicate to events - barnights, cinema, go visit the
beardies etc<br />
Bookcrawl - 3rd or 4th Saturday of term<br />
LoTR exhibit at science museum - likely to be very good, try to organise a
trip to see it</p>

<p><b>8. Picocon</b><br />
Less cryptic poster campaign needed<br />
Stuff to be planned later</p>

<p><b>9. Other Business</b><br />
Stuff to be bought: DVD player, new VHS player, new library computer<br />
Capital expenditure plan unlikely to help with this this year<br />
Also need a chair for the computer<br />
Use website more, especially the newsboard</p>

<p>Meeting closed at 19:58</p>
