<h3>Picocon Subcommittee's Report</h3>
Picocon!!!! Sat Feb. 17th. Good and bad, It Will happen has some problems:
We do have three guests, we have vendors, we have fantasy centre porcupine books and playing games. Tom Womack would like one table to sell off his books.
Trying to contact Elrich But as we are pushed for space it won't matter if they don't show up. Rooms, good news we have Db's and De Vinci’s. Bad news
due to cross lines we have one of the top room meeting rooms for the talks, Dave (Chair) in process of
contacting the Indian soc who have the UGH. Society in concert hall is Chinese Soc and Dave will talk to them also.
 We could be out by 3-4 <br>
If both fall through... Dark corner of DB's could be used for talks. Also Cypriot Soc need it afterwards but shouldn't be a problem.

<br>
We need to make sure the Bar will have lots of Ale for the beards. Time table
needs to be draw up, most likely by looking at last year's. <br>
