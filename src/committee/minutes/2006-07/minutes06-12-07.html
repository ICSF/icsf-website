<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
We have 1058 pounds we have spent 7 out of SGI, we also have £170 to get
 from the union when we get another 11 members (Wouter +10), Union has not
entered our income onto the website so we're running off Tim's system. <br>
The web
joining system doesn't work properly....the Mort trip cost us £16.16 and we made a golden turtle,
<br />
<br>
Budgeting:
It's December.... due end of January, three things
<br>
Picocon budget to go to Union, but it might not count as a trade fair.

We lost our equipment budget, we need to buy 3 new (Tim in charge) chairs and maybe a new desk.

We have authors and they are excited, and Charlie Stress will make his own way
