-We have very healthy refundables.<br>
-(<I>Smithers</I>) Doesn't this boil down to "We can't get <I>all </I>of the shiney

-(<I>Chair</I>) Harlington Trust (segue to Librarian's Report).<br>
<BR>

<h3>Librarian's Report</h3>
<b><i>We need more shelf space.  How?</i></b>
<br>
- Basically, we have to appeal for more shelving<br>
-<i>Possiblity of sliding shelves</i><br>
	-would decrease reading space<br>
	-structural pillar in the way<br>
	-Safety?<br>
	-Multi-person browsing<br>
	-Library closed while installing.<br>
	-Lots more space (approx double?)<br>
	-We can argue to funders that sliding shelves are a concrete advantage.<br>
	-Need to find a supplier.<br>
-<i>Possibility of higher shelves.</i><br>
	-lighting in the way, possible to move?<br>
	-difficult to reach/browse<br>
	-another ~20% space<br>
	-&pound;150-&pound;160 per unit<br>
	-People providing funding will question proposal, &ldquo;replace shelves with shelves&rdquo;<br>
-<i>Redesign with existing selves from scratch.</i><br>
	-Not enough information at present.<br>
	-(<I>Sergey</I>)Space being used inefficiently, will look at alternatives for layout<br>
-<i>Ask for another area to use as stacks</i><br>
-No storage space in union, will ask anyway<br>
-Not really suitable, risk of damage to books, difficult to access<br>
-<i>Other options</i><br>
-Design Competion to Civ Eng dept.<br>
-Talk to Eric Lai re: library moving in near future<br><br>
-(<I>Chair</I>)Stop expansion of library at some point?<br>
-Still books still being published, still have gaping holes in collection.<br>
-Library been increasing at about 500 a year (NB: Having checked numbers, this seems a fairly accurate.  A minimum annual increase of 100 is what I'd estimate to keep the society's library genuinely viable, although totally killing the purchases would have only delayed effect by reducing our library-only members- Peter).<br>
-in top 30 sci-fi libraries in world.<br>
-in top 3 student libraries in world.<br>
-Some very rare books, difficult to justify getting rid of, even things which are rarely read, couldn't be replaced should there be a future demand.<br>
-Possible to open up to researchers, things published outside UK may only be available in Liverpool. (To be discussed at a later date).<br>
-Against philosophy of library to get rid of books.<br>
-Could decrease social space.<br>
	-Effect of this would be loss of active members, to make future committee, come back as elders, make donations etc.<br>
	-Risk of loss of active members through removal of &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; reading space, inc. between shelves.<br>
	-Generate a reading corner behind pillar with chairs ?<br>
-Conversely, it is easy to forget that, actually, the library, rather than the social aspect, is what interests the majority (75%) of our members.<br>

<br>
-<i>Large capital purchases</i><br>
- Peter doesn't like making large purchases without committee's OK<br>
-Buffy(DVD) &ndash; has been bought<br>
		-Futurama(DVD) (Seasons 1-4, &pound;80) (Vote: all in favour, excluding 2 Abstentions) (Will try to sell old videos)<br>
		-X-files(DVD)(Seasons 3-5, &pound;60)(Would only be to save shelf space - infrequently watched) (Vote: against)<br>
		-Lost(DVD) Wait until the price drops<br>
		-Blake's 7(DVD) Classic sci fi, only want from completest point of view, will not be watched often.<br>
		-Stargate(DVD) Seasons 2-6, &pound;20 a season (6 in favour, 2 against, 3 abstentions)<br>
			 - Peter watches this while wearing all his clothing. There was a round of applause.<br>
		-Replace all Starwars(DVD) &lt;&pound;100 - Librarian to retunr with actual numbers<br>
		-Battlestar Galactica season 2(DVD) &pound;35, (7 in favour, 4 abstentions)<br>		-Replace all Starwars(DVD) &lt;&pound;100<br>
-Treasurer to draw up budget with librarian<br>
<BR>
