			<strong>2.3 BOGS</strong>
			<br>We were approachd at Picocon by Dave Clemments and Tom Yates, and told that 1000 books were donated in 1987.  The warden of Beit Hall donated these and is about to retire, something should be done to recognise him.
			<br>This means that we need to sort out BOGS, it is suggested that we should give some drafts to Phil as he has the 'right' sense of humour.
			<br>The following people should be 'BOGGED': Juliet McKenna, Porcupine Books, PJ Finley (Donater mentioned above) and then possible ex. chairs - though it should NOT become a automatic thing.
