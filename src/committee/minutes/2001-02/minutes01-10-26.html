<h3>Money (aka Treasurers Report)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We currently have 75ish Full Union Members (25 to get)
	<li>We need to check that the Union will pay the full cost of our chairs - they told us to buy the more expensive ones!
	<li>The Freshers Budget has been spent
	<li>We currently have a (much reduced from last year) book buying budget of £140 - we have spent around a third of this already - general consensus was to fund book buying from Refundables.  The budget is like this because of union cut-backs and because we split the budget into 'new' and 'replacements' - the union then told us that we should not be losing books and to make a contingency claim.  It was agreed that we should discuss this further later.
	<li>We need to get the insurance sorted asap so we can concentrate on other things.
	<li>Of the £300 publicity budget we have spent £70 - the Wyrms need to cost less (ie be A5)
	<li>Get more shelves sponsored
</ul>
<h3>Missing stock</h3>
<p>Stock check of videos reveals 11 missing.  Not sure how many books are missing - we need to do a stock take! Everybody volunteers to help.  Solutions include a security mirror to see into book shelves, and the backup person keeping an eye out.  Library rules need to be posted explaining how to take out a book and small print reserving the right to chuck anybody out.</p>
<h3>Publicity / Fanzine / Wyrmtounges</h3>
<p>12pt please! (so can be reduced to fit A5).  Also worth noting it normally takes £80 - £120 to produce Wyrmtounge so that leaves £110 - £150 for any future Wyrms and poster campaigns.  Need to check breakdown to see how much should be allocated to publicity and Wyrm respectively.</p>
<p>Last years members who have not joined / people from sign up sheets who have not signed up need to be mailshotted by yours Truly.
<h3>Picocon</h3>
<p>We would like to run Picocon on the 9th of February.  This should be sent to 'Ansible' and 'Fans Across the World' once a room has been booked.</p>
<p>Authors to invite: Juliet McKenna (but not as guest), Peter F Hamilton, Ken McLeod, China Meiville (sic.), Philip Pullman, Stephen Baxter.  We should use £25 as a cap on Speaker costs (at least as a starting point!).  Interface with Eemeli and Till re projection (or Phil).</p>
<p>Other Events for Picocon: Dalek Racing, Book Sellers (also need to be informed of date), Fencing Club (pos), Juggling (pos), Robot Wars Teams.</p>
<p>It is 25 years (we think!) of ICSF - why not make this a big thing for advertising, have a cake, try to get oldest member we can to cut the cake etc. It would be a good idea to check with Cosmic Ferret re age of club.</p>
<h3>Other Events</h3>
<b>Barnights</b>
<p>Move to one a month - committee are to attend as much as pos - make them a bigger thing. Possibly also run them in other places eg. The Star, The Churchill Arms.</p>
<p>First one on 8th November.</p>
<b>Christmas Meal</b>
<p>Go to the Japanese restaurant that Fellwanderers went to Freshers meal (Leicester Square) and then on to see Hobbit.</p>
<b>Society trip to Ton in December</b>
<p>Committee members are to stop moaning about this event.</p>
<b>Films</b>
<p>Harry Potter - book 20 (30?) tickets ASAP</p>
<p>LORT</p>
<p>Go to see films in Union on Thursday (or the Comedy).</p>
<b>TV at lunchtimes</b>
<p>Dune to be shown on Tuesdays once current schedule finished</p>
<p>A suggestions list to be put up and then a schedule to be drawn up by Sec. for fortnightly periods</p>

<p><i>Meeting Closed 19:45</i> (exactly</p>
