	<h3>Absent:</h3>
	<div class="peoples">Alex Stubbley (Publicity Officer)</div>

	<h3>Admission of last meeting’s minutes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Minutes accepted without objection.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Actions from last meeting</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Caption competition: This will now (obviously) be impossible to complete in time for Freshers’ Fair, so it is being planned for Femtocon instead.
		<ul>
			<li class="action">David McBride: Find suitable pictures</li>
			<li class="action">Benedict: prepare them for captioning.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>UCLSF now has almost all the donated books, and will be returning for the rest shortly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Femtocon (Or, the chair’s report)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Check the room booking for Femtocon.
		<ul>
			<li class="action">Fluffy: do this!</li>
			<li>Fluffy and Rosie both have commitment problems for this and cannot make it at all; Rebecca and Joseph will have trouble being on time for similar reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Peter (on behalf of Joseph) Please be early and help set up! There may be food offered as a bribe.</li>
		<li>We will need someone to do tours of the library</li>
		<li>Don’t forget the Freshers’ books!
		<ul>
			<li>Possibly only after sign-up.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Alex Cameron proposed a dummy bank account to allow freshers to sign up online without entering their card details.
		<ul>
			<li>John and Fluffy are both very uncomfortable with this. It will not be done.</li>
			<li class="motion passed">Should paper forms be used at Femtocon?	&nbsp; For: 5(+1); Against: 2(+1)
			<ul>
				<li class="action">Fluffy: Inform the union that we will be using paper sign-up forms at Femtocon.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Treasurer's Report (John Davenport)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>All is well, except that people have been leaving unnamed receipts in the cashbox.
		<ul>
			<li>The receipts in question belonged to Benedict (on behalf of Alex Cameron) and Ed Boff.</li>
			<li>Ideally, please give your receipts to John, and explain what they’re for.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Membership is going reasonably well (it’s at about 30).
		<ul>
			<li>Fluffy plans a proposal to allow clubs to reduce their membership targets now, since online membership has reduced signups (our target is currently 80 members).</li>
			<li>The Union’s mess-up at Freshers’ Fair was also unhelpful.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Picocon Sofa</h3>
<span class="entrance">The Picocon Sofa enters.</span>
	<p>“Does the Picocon Sofa have anything to report?”<br/>“No.”</p>
<span class="exit">The Picocon Sofa leaves the meeting.</span>

	<h3>General ICSF Business</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Tour of the Science Museum’s new exhibit.
		<ul>
			<li>We don’t have a date. The beginning of November? Mid-November.</li>
			<li class="action">Rosie: Organise this.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Dune artwork (or the abandoned Dune film set to star Salvador Dali)
		<ul>
			<li>The exhibition is only on until 30th October.</li>
			<li>Should we include this in the bookcrawl?</li>
			<li class="action">Rosie: Check this, and e-mail the committee with details.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Bar night
		<ul>
			<li>In the Tea Clipper
			<ul>
				<li>Should we move there permanently?
				<ul>
					<li>Anecdotal evidence indicates poor attendance of Tea Clipper bar nights</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>There should be two posses (to take freshers and lost souls from the library), one at 6PM and one at 6:30 PM.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li class="action">Rosie: Send out a map of the route to the Tea Clipper.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Cinema trips
		<ul>
			<li>What should we see?
			<ul>
				<li>District 9?</li>
				<li>Should we use Orange Wednesdays to our advantage?</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>A minion is required for this, in exchange for non-sexual favours</li>
			<li>Mark Rutland has been implicated in this.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Film showing in conjunction with Cinema Soc
		<ul>
			<li>It currently has no committee.</li>
			<li>It might be feasible if ICSF do all the actual work</li>
			<li class="action">Fluffy: Talk to Tom (last year’s chair).</li>
			<li>We would have to:
			<ul>
				<li>Put forward the necessary money (£100)</li>
				<li>Set up chairs, book the room &c.&c.</li>
				<li>Advertise</li>
				<li>Deal with takings</li>
				<li>Do the actual projection (maybe).</li>
				<li>Share any profits, but absorb any losses</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li class="action">Everyone: Think of suitable films for a showing.</li>
			<li>This will not be feasible until December-ish.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Uncopied DVDs
		<ul>
			<li>Mark will be in ICSF all day on Wednesdays: he can copy disks then.</li>
			<li>The software to do this exists on the ICSF computer, but the machine itself makes copies incredibly slowly.
			<ul>
				<li>Could we copy disk-disk, with two DVD drives?</li>
				<li>We could also hijack the Department of Computing for this (nefarious) purpose</li>
				<li>It is also possible to book EEng room 304a.</li>
				<li>It takes approximately one hour to make a copy.</li>
				<li class="action">David McBride: Cause this to be so.</li>
			</ul></li>

			<li class="motion passed">Reimburse people for the dual-layer disks to copy onto? &nbsp; For: 9(+1); Against: 0(+1); Abstaining: 1.</li>
			<li class="motion failed">Deposits are too open to accidental abuse, as well as all the logistical problems. This is deemed a BAD idea (though there was one vote in favour).</li>
			<li>Note: Don’t abuse the Head Librarian’s password. Changing this is in progress/being discussed.
			<ul>
				<li>Is Gabriel’s special exemption to be removed?
				<ul>
					<li>Not the time or place to discuss this.</li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul></li>

			<li>Peter suggests that it is ICSF standing policy to lend uncopied films, but not series disks. Fluffy disagrees that it is so.
			<ul>
				<li>Losing disks is rare</li>
				<li class="motion passed">Should ICSF policy be to lend out uncopied films, but not to lend uncopied series disks? &nbsp; For: 10(+2); Against: 1</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Any Other Business</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Keylist
		<ul>
			<li>It is currently quite bloated.
			<ul>
				<li>Karne and Michele can possibly be removed</li>
				<li>Cat and Baz can be removed once they have moved to Manchester</li>
				<li>Simon Moxon and Mark Rutland need to be added.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li class="action">Rebecca & Fluffy: Update the keylist.</li>
			<li>Peter disapproves of pruning the keylist (and of people running “his” society)</li>
			<li>Nothing is to be done withut committee approval.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Beanbag Sofa
		<ul>
			<li>Crowding is an issue, but only once or twice a week.</li>
			<li>Vote: Should the bean-bag sofa stay?
			<ul>
				<li>Strongly against: 3</li>
				<li>Mildly against: 1</li>
				<li>Indifferent: 2</li>
				<li>Mildly in favour: 1</li>
				<li>Strongly in favour: 6</li>
			</ul></li>

			<li class="action">Rebecca: Minute in the next meeting that this is to be re-examined again.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
