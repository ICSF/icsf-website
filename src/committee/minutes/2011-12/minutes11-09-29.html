	<h3>General Business</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The minutes of the meeting 25/5/2011 were approved unanimously</li>
		<li>Lucy has not had any responses from locations of the formal dinner
		<ul>
			<li>The Beit prices were circulated on icsf-committee previously</li>
			<li>More suggestions are needed for places to try</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The year has begun. Term has not. Semantics were briefly discussed</li>
		<li>Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are without a Treasurer
		<ul>
			<li>An EGM will happen as soon as the exec get their act together</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Most of the committee have done their training quizzes and joined the society
		<ul>

			<li class="action">Everyone to join the society</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fresher's Fayre</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fresher's Fayre is on Tuesday, setup form 10am</li>
		<li>Members of the committee are willing to help
		<ul>
			<li>We should also ask the list</li>
			<li class="action">Benedict to email icsf-list for help</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The poster designs look gooood
		<ul>

		</li>
		<li>Wyrmtongue is steadily coming together
		<ul>
			<li>The number of copies of Wyrm required was discussed</li>
			<li>The final figure was probably a couple of hundred</li>
		</li>
		<li>Fresher's Fayre falls on the same day as an Old Fart's barnight
		<ul>
			<li>Taking the freshers to that would be unfair on both sides</li>
			<li>What we do in the evening for the freshers depends on how many hang around</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fresher's Events</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="action">Amanda to decide on library showings (if appropriate)</li>

		<li>The east basement: it is booked...almost  (Curse you, dance)</li>
		<li>SciFi have a desk and run people to library</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Picocon Bookings</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>They haven not yet been done</li>
		<li class="action">Maciej to do the bookings</li>
		<li>It was suggested that we should possibly write to Terry Pratchett
		<ul>
			<li>There were mixed feelings about this</li>
			<li>It would be absolutely awesome</li>
			<li>However, he's unlikely to come</li>
			<li>We'd never be able find space to host him in Imperial</li>
			<li>We'd have to book him n years in advance, putting burden on future committees</li>
			<li>He'd over shadow anyone else we could ask</li>
			<li>It would probably make all future Picocons feel less by comparison</li>
		</ul>The point was deferred to a later meeting</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Any other business</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="motion passed">Lucy McGregor was unanimously elected Acting Treasurer</li>
