			Recent events have gone well for the most part. Excellent turnout at Femtocon. Darwin Centre trip well attended. Many people coming to Magic nights. Mmm, more converts.
			<br />However, rapidly declining attendance at video evenings. Nobody turned up for Eight Legged Freaks; this is the movie's fault.

		<td width="70%">
			<i>The following is Simon's financial report as emailed to the committee list, with the corrections he made after discussion on the list.</i>
			<br />1) Contingency claim is still being handled by the SCC, there has been
little movement so far on this due to their incompetence.

			<br />2) The Desk top sorter that has been charged to us is being sorted by the
union - I believe that aziz is doing this.

			<br />3) The library budget has been increased by £150 i.e. from £500 to
£650.  This money is to tide the library over until the first committee
meeting after picocon, i.e. the picocon debrief.

			<br />4) The money in refundables (approx £1134) is not all spare money.  Some of
it has been spent, i.e. on books for the lib (approx £150) and more has been
earmarked for other purposes, e.g. publicity (£100) and the Wyrms/fanzine.
Advertising money raised is a bonus and goes to improving the wyrms and the
fanzine (approx £200 combined). Note that this list of expenses is not
exhaustative.

			<br />5) A point for Picocon.  Any takings recieved must be banked intact!
paying our expenses out of the takings, then banking the profit
remaining is technically FRAUD and obviously this is not going to
happen.  If necessary we could use a float.  The general consensus seems to
be to talk to Ben about exactly what we can do, with the idea of running a
petty cash system (fully documented) and replacing any cash removed with
money after the event (so that the takings are effectively banked intact)
then refunding the member who supplied the money, claiming it as "Picocon
expenses" so that we have a few, large claims for picocon, rather than
thousands of tiny ones.

			<br />Those were the main points raised. The budget is online at <a href="http://www2.union.ic.ac.uk/money/FinanceFiles/266/1999/budget.shtml">http://www2.union.ic.ac.uk/money/FinanceFiles/266/1999/budget.shtml</a>

			<br />Budget heads:
			<br />Library:   £169.49
			<br />Freshers:  £59.61
			<br />Wyrm :     £85 (+ £45 from advertising)
			<br />Fanzine:   £100 (+ any of the £45 from the wyrm advertising)
			<br />Publicity: £42.02
			<br />Speakers:  £100
			<br />Randoms:   £91.55
			<br />We have so far raised £534 from membership, with a total of 77 members, 70
of whom are "real" union subsidised members.

			<br />As an aside anyone who is waiting for cheques the scc treasurer has promised
that they will be ready by friday afternoon.  This probably means that they
will be arriving next week, but we can but hope.

		Fresher attendance to events is bad. Freshers scared off by loud annoying people in library at lunchtimes.
		<br />Magic games and chatting to be moved to back of library, NOT in front of door.
		<br />Duty librarians and committee members to keep an eye on things: shush people who are too loud, chat with anyone looking scared in the corner, welcome freshers as they come in.
		<br />Formally close library at 14:00 every day to clear out loungers and tidy up. Library may be opened later if committee or duty librarians wish.

			<br />Sign with "ICSF Library" and opening hours to be placed at top of library window. Mouse offered to take care of this iirc.
			<br />We should brand flyers, Wyrms, etc. with ICSF crest or something. Eemeli please note.
