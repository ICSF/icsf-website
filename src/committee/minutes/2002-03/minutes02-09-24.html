<h3>6. Financial Procedure</h3>
<p>How to take cash (and cheques, but we try not to take cheques) in the library. Also, when people join up, check their email addresses. Copy of this procedure attached to agenda (Paper 3). A copy should also be put in the cashbox in the library for reference.
<br />Don't pin receipts to the noticeboard, give them to Peter or Simon. Issue a receipt for ALL money taken, and count the cashbox at the end of the day. If more than £25, tell Simon/Peter so it can be banked.</p>
