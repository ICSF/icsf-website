60 members plus, 6 affiliates all fully paid in<br>
&pound;1400 in refundables (we have the monies!)...about 1100 from last year<br>
Outgoing treasurer claims his due<br>
&pound;150 spent on books and stuff so far<br>
Tim not to get charged with fraud, whilst on fire<br>

75% of target membership so far<br>
</p>

<h4>Pico-con</h4>
<p>
Rather a separate Pico-con meeting next week<br>
Looks like it will be held on 18th Feb<br>
Ben apologies for early departure...Secretary shakes fist<br>
</p>

<h4>DVDs</h4>
<p>
Copyright laws vaguely investigated<br>
No distinction between videos and DVDs<br>
No more illegal than what we already do<br>
Can't really implement rental fees for them<br>
Do we want to keep on buying DVDs? YES motion unopposed (Ian indifferent)<br>
Lending DVDs? Half the members seem to think they can<br>
&gt;Damage to DVDs an issue<br>

&gt;Might be able to lend out copies instead...£2 damage charge?<br>
&gt;Get DVD burner?<br>
&gt;Might need a more powerful computer to do that<br>
Lending copies not originals...vote = unanimous<br>
Need to announce lending policy explicitly<br>
In the meantime, DVDs still not to be lent<br>
Get a decent filing system, a bunch of DVDRs for the lib<br>
Originals do not leave library or get played<br>
Copyright issues...Have to tell them not to copy<br>

Need to get some kind of form to sign<br>
E-mail list, stickers on disks<br>
Can only accept legal DVDs, NO COPIES TO BE ACCEPTED<br>
Not any<br>
None<br>
We don't want to go to the special hell<br>
Report of this to be drafted<br>
Provisions for damage, &pound;1 fee (on principle), note of damage made<br>
Need to speak to Simon briefly about this<br>

Accurate record will need to be kept to ensure a happy union<br>
Start burning ASAP<br>
Aim to start lending them for the start of next term<br>
</p>

<h4>Committiee Contacts</h4>
<p>
Should all exchange phone numbers at some point, so we can keep in touch<br>
</p>

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>
Need to make sure it's internally consistent<br>
</p>

<h4>Wyrm</h4>
<p>
Plea for stuff for next months Wyrm<br>
Too many left-handed people!!(50% of members present)<br>
Also, everyone except Alex has glasses...<br>
Put Wyrm in more places...maybe where Felix comes out.<br>
</p>

<h4>AOB</h4>
<p>
E-mail list - some members seem not to be getting mail<br>
Key list needs rejigging (before next term)<br>
Duty librarians...redundent it seems<br>
</p>
