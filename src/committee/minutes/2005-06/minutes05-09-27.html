<h3>Chair's Report</h3>
<p>
<i>"Good news everybody!"</i> <br>
Welcome back and congratulations on being 'not dead'.<br>
How will poor Smithers cope with the horrors of 2nd year physics?<br>
Well done for all not failing.<br>
This year we want lots of fresehers to replace the large number of graduates who are moving on with their lives.<br>
Hey Ali.<br>
More female members would be nice.<br>
Vicky:<i>"There are female members, wht we need are more 'active' female members"</i><br>
All: <i>"LOL"</i><br>
Ian: <i>"The database says we have 16% female members...but the what percentage is edible?"</i><br>
</p>

<h3>Librians Report</h3>
<p>
What?<br>
Actually, thats pretty much it...<br>
We have some new shelves and some new books.<br>
Baz: <i>"I suggest we lay siege to orbit with a trebuchet"</i>...Best trebuchet ever!<br>
Items in stock: 6370 books, 173 graphic novels, 1023 video, 37 dvds.<br>
</p>

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<p>
Tim absent, but Malc is able to provide a few useful pieces of information<br>
£800 more money than last year, due to the brilliance of the retiring treasurer?<br>
Currently it seems we have double the budget we are supposed to have...we should blame/congratulate Simon.<br>
Since we have lots of money we should consider reducing the membership fee.<br>
<b>Budget:</b>
£50.00 equipment<br>
£316.66 books/videos<br>
£100.00 pico-con speakers<br>
£20.00 publicity<br>
Things we might wnat to use the money for: Widescreen TV, lower fees, tractor beam to attract freshers.<br>
<i>Sec's note: much discussion of membership fees ensues</i><br>
Membership is to be set at a flat rate of £8, for full membership. This year there will be no seperate book/video membership.<br>
Hopefully this will increase membership, but refundables may take an initial hit.<br>
This years target membership is 80<br>
</p>

<h3>Picocon Sofa's Report</h3>
<p>
Ali has attempted to contact a few authors: Steven Baxter, Suzanna Clarke, Tom Holton. He has not heard back from any yet.<br>
Vicky to prod Ben very hard.<br>
Ali and Kath to push Ben in right direction.<br>
There is a possibility that the union building could be being refurbished when Picocon is supposed to be taking place. Some contingency plans are being considered.
</p>

<h2>Start of Term</h2>

<h3>Freshers Fair</h3>
<p>
Stall is in the UDH<br>
Sci-fi, Meat Soc. and Wargames are all close together. Also no urban music nearby...hurray!!<br>
Put on stall...Darleks, Spare books/ videos, Fanzienes, Freshers Wyrmtounge, Haribo.<br>
Meal after freshers fair, being co-ordinated by Wargames.<br>
Daves posters are fantastic!<br>
Need to standardise information formats on all posters.<br>
Putting up posters is a job for more than one person.<br>
Consider donating money to MCCR media budget so that we can use the photocopiers without guilty feelings.<br>
Baz to talk Dave and Smithers through photocopier use.<br>
Smithers requests more submissions for wyrm.<br>
Review of Serenity poster = "OMG kungfu ninja WTF"<br>
Dave: <i>"Is there any chance a hover might see the inside of the library at some point."</i><br>

</p>

<b>Who:</b> Us and freshers
<b>What:</b>
<b>When:</b> Wed 12th Oct in concert hall 10-5. Set up from 10, start by 12 leave *promptly* at 5<br>
Need posters up around college.<br>
<b>What we'll have on:</b> easy quiz, firefly playing throuhout, LAN-gaming...<br>
<i>Sec's note: at this point the talk turned into techno babble. This eventually passed...</i><br>
Alex happy to run the quiz as he enjoys getting up on stage and making a fool of himself, why stop now?<br>
We have to finish early so we should do something after...perhaps a trip to see Serenity.<br>
</p>

<h3>Other Start of Term Events</h3>
<p>
Trip to Serenity - Alex excited (no really...)<br>
Ultraviolet showing<br>
Barnight<br>
BSFA - beard, sweater, sandals at least 2 of the three...somebody with beard and sandals, but no sweater, doesn't bear thinking about...maybe his beard could be so long it would cover himself...AHH! WOOKIE MAN!!<br>

</p>

Things to show: Ultra Violet, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica (new version), Star Wars alldayer, B5.<br>
We have a list of lunchtime films (in Alex's possession) - need to ROTA them.<br>
People need to e-mail times when they are free to be duty librarians.<br>
We need membership cards for normal and comittiee members of the society. (Mark and Ian are sorting this out) Can we get photo's on them?<br>
Key list might require some updating.
</p>

<h3>Any Other Buisness</h3>
<p>
<b>Don't scare the freshers!</b><br>
Less RPG conversations early on, they are hard for others to join in with.<br>
People we would ask to avoid the library during freshers week: Baz, Steeve, Adam, Aragnathor...this is to avoid scaring the freshers...<br>
Tuesday Magic?<br>
Hello Simon<br>
