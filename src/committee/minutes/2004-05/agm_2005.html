<h1>Minutes of ICSF AGM, 16/03/05</h1>
<P><B>Present:</b> Simon (Chair), Kath (Chair of Vice), Malcolm (Treasurer), Alex (Secretary), Ian (Librarian), Ali (Picocon Sofa), Ben (Fanzine Editor), Mital(Projectionist), Mark (Mook), Matt, Tim, Cristina, Smithers, Ulrich, Steve, Baz, Tiny Tom, Jake, Mouse, Karne, Dave Bartram, Dave Weir.<br />
<b>Apologies:</b> The Society apologises for Mital<br />
<B>AWOL:</b> Nemo.</P>

<P><I>Meeting opens: 1812</I></P>



<h3>Chair's Report</h3>

<p>This year, stuff happened. A good year on the whole.<br />
Without further ado, I pass you on to the other officers' reports.</P>



<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>

<P>We have money, for which Malcolm takes full credit.<br />
<I>A Profits/Losses sheet is passed round as a handout. Copies available on request.</I><br />
We have more members than last year, but fewer keen ones.<br />
84 members total this year as against 69 last year.<br />
We made a good profit at Picocon.<br />
This leaves us with about £800 to spend.</P>

<P>Any questions?<br />
<I>How come this P&L sheet shows the elections as earning us money?</I> Recall that people got to allocate 25p to their club of choice.<br />
<I>Why didn't we buy doughnuts with that money?</I> (No answer)</P>



<h3>Picocon Sofa's Report</h3>

<P>Picocon went well.<br />
Fewer people than last year (105 this year, ~120 last year)<br />
<I>Sec's note: For a while, it was much too noisy to take notes.</I></P>



<h3>Wyrmtongue/Fanzine Editor's Report</h3>

<P>Ben can honestly say that he has not produced a bad Wyrmtongue. <I>(laughter)</I><br />
Please write things over Easter.<br />
There will be a Wyrm next term, and the Fanzine will come out in Summer.</P>



<h3>Librarian's Report</h3>

<P>People bought things, which was good.<br />
People continued to leave the library in a state, which was not good.</P>

<P>Any questions?<br />
<I>How many books do we now have?</i> Over 7000.<br />
<I>What about those shelves?</i> Still trying to find out what's happened.<br />
<i>What's your opinion on the larger bin?</i> A good thing, especially since people's lunches seem to have more packaging.<br />
<i>How come still nobody can get stuff in?</I> It's due to the entropic field projected by Dave Clements.</P>



<h3>Chair of Vice's Report</h3>

<P>Barnights have been alcoholic.<br />
There have been maybe fewer events than there should have been, but those that there were went well.<br />
No events are planned next term, due to Kath's imminent exams.</P>




<h3>Projectionist's Report</h3>

<P>There has been no projectioning this year. Maybe next year.<br />
However, Mital can claim not to have been out of focus once.</P>

<P>Any questions?<br />
<I>As a projectionist, shouldn't you be able to predict the future?</I> Mystic Mital predicts that Steve will get drunk. All are amazed.</P>

<h3>Any Other Business?</h3>

<P>Brief discussion was made of the planned road trip to Hay on Wye. Sadly, I've lost the sheet of paper with the minutes for this section; suffice it say, the upshot was that no money will be allocated until after the trip has happened and we can judge its success.</P>

<P><I>Meeting closed: 1955</I></P>

<h2>Candidates - speeches and Q&amp;A</h2>

<P>It should be noted that in all following elections, Norfolk the Dalek represents RON (re-open nominations)</P>

<h4>Chair</h4>

<P>Alex and Norfolk stand for the position of Chair.</P>

<P>Alex's manifesto:<ol>
<li>We need a Chair so the Union will let us exist as a society.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of time in the library anyway.</li>
<li>I know roughly what's going on as a result of paying attention in committee meetings this year.</li>
<li>I intend to keep things running smoothly.</li>
<li>And try to attract more freshers next year.</li></ol></P>
<P>Norfolk's Manifesto: You will all be exterminated.</P>

<P>Questions to the Candidates:</P>
<P><I>What's your opinion on fat old men hanging around the library?</i> Fine in moderation, don't scare the freshers.<br />
<I>Will you obey the Old Ones?</i> If by Old Ones you mean Simon as DPC&S, then yes. <I>(This is ruled to be good enough)</I><br />
<I>What is your policy on bad films?</i> We'll keep trying to sell them to Dave at Picocon.<br />
<I>Which fictional character do you base your leadership style on?</i> Westley, from the Princess Bride.<br />
<I>What is your policy on good books/films that aren't technically Science Fiction/Fantasy?</i> They're very nice if someone wants to donate them, but they really can't be bought with society money.<br />
<I>What would you do if someone donated a load of Gor books?</i> We'd probably have to keep the ones we don't have, although still keep them locked away; we'd burn the rest and (especially) the person who donated them.<br />
<I>What's your opinion on adding Macguyver to the library?</i> Technically we already have some, it's just labelled as Stargate.<br />
<I>How will you cope with the extensive potting you're going to get next year?</i> I'll live. It may not be pretty, but I'll survive.<br />
<I>How will you cope with Aero next year?</i> See above.</P>

<P>Voting, then:<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: 17<br />
Votes to eliminate Alex: 1<br />
<b>Alex duly elected Chair.</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Librarian</h4>

<P>Ali, Ian and Norfolk all stand for librarian. The first and second placed candidates will both be librarians.</P>

<P>Ali has been a successful Picocon Sofa; moreover he's a PhD student and so has time to do things in the evenings and at weekends.<br />
Ian has been a successful librarian this year despite being slightly dropped into it; he'll do even better next year.<br />
Norfolk will exterminate everyone.</P>

<P>Questions to the candidates:</P>
<P><I>What's your policy on items which have bought without your consent as a librarian?</I><br />
Ian: If they didn't get my permission, they get no money for it.<br />
Ali: People can bring stuff, but we won't necessarily buy it. Only maybe.<br />
Norfolk: Kill them and take their stuff.<br />
<I>What's your opinion on getting the new Dr Who?</I><br />
Norfolk: Exterminate the Doctor! <br />
Ali: We'll see if it's any good before we definitely get it. <br />
Ian: ditto, but it also depends on price and format.<br />
<I>What would you intend by way of planned film showings at the start of next year?</I> <br />
Ian: Have planned videos for at least the first two weeks, after which we can return to people choosing what they want to watch. <br />
Ali: I agree, with the caveat that Duty Librarians should have input on what is watched on their day.<br />
<I>Should the library branch out further into new formats?</I><br />
Ali: We already have some DVDs and we have some more coming in, but on the whole we should still stick with VHS for now.<br />
Ian: Agreed; DVDs are inherently less lendable.<br />
<I>If there were a budget cut, what would you buy or stop buying?</I><br />
Ian: Continue to buy both books and videos.<br />
Ali: Me too.<br />
<I>How do you plan to choose duty librarians?</I><br />
Ali: Delegate on a daily basis whilst keeping overall control.<br />
Ian: It would have happened this year. Volunteers will be assigned to weekly rota.<br />
Norfolk: Anyone who refuses to be minioned will be exterminated.<br />
<I>What would you recommend to someone new to SF?</i><br />
Ali: Well, not Gor or early Gwyneth Jones. Maybe Kim Stanley Robinson, Terry Pratchett, Tom Holt.<br />
Ian: Depends what they're looking for.<br />
Norfolk: The episode of Dr Who without the Doctor in it.<br />
<I>Should we keep buying graphic novels?</I><br />
Ali: We'll divide up the budget according to what the members want. We'll strongly push the online request list as a way to find this out.<br />
Ian: People read them and enjoy them, therefore they should be bought. But we'll use our discretion, and keep to a few at a time.<br />
<I>How will you prevent falling cielings?</I><br />
Ian: By not destroying them.<br />
Ali: By keeping Ian happy. Maybe with a happiness spell.<br />
<I>Do you two have any different opinions? Because you seem quite close on most points.</I><br />
Ali: Not really!<br />
Ian: I don't like jeans.<br />
Norfolk: is a dalek.<br />
<I>Can you sum up your feelings in one meme?</I><br />
Ian: It's powered by love. Also, you have to wind it.<br />
Ali: Meep!<br />
<I>If you had to identify yourself with a day of the week, which day would you choose?</I><br />
Ian: Wednesday.<br />
Ali: Saturday.</P>

<P>Phew. Voting at last:<br />
<b>Round one:</B><br />
Votes to eliminate Ali: 0<br />
Votes to eliminate Ian: 0<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: All of them.<br />
<b>Norfolk is duly eliminated.<br />
Round two:</b><br />
Ali: 12<br />
Ian: 7<br />
<b>Ian duly elected as Chief Librarian; Ali as Assistant Librarian.</b><br />
<br />
</P>

<h4>Chair of Vice</h4>

<P>Malcolm, Cristina and Norfolk are standing for Chair of Vice.<br />
Malcolm has been a competent treasurer this year; he's done some serious work and wants to do something fun.<br />
Cristina has lots of experience telling people what to do; she intends to organise barnights and ensure that the Chair doesn't fail.<br />
Norfolk still wants to exterminate people.</P>

<P>Questions for the candidates:<br />
<I>How will your studies next year affect your ability to do your job?</I><br />
Norfolk doesn't study. He's a dalek.<br />
Cristina: will be fine, 3rd year Aero is less bad than 2nd.<br />
Malcolm: will be doing a PhD so will have lots of time.<br />
<I>What are your vices?</I><br />
Norfolk: Killing people.<br />
Malcolm: Sloth, gluttony, greed and lust are a good start.<br />
Cristina is deemed to be Alex's vice. Alex turns slightly scarlet.<br />
<I>What do you see your responsibilities as Chair of Vice as being, other than organising bar nights?</I><br />
Malcolm: Emergency Chair should the current Chair have to step down.<br />
Cristina: That, and organising other events. We need more events to draw in non-resident members, eg film trips.<br />
Norfolk: Extermination of all humans.<br />
<I>How do you organise a barnight?</I><br />
Malcolm: Go to the bar and declare your interest. Go to Dave Parry and check you have the money. Go back to the bar and say 'Dave Parry says we can'.<br />
Cristina: What he said. Extra-early if you want a barrel of beer.<br />
<I>Which previous Chair of Vice would you wish to model yourself on?</I><br />
Malcolm: Karne.<br />
Cristina: Has only really known Kath, so has to choose her.<br />
Norfolk: Himself.<br />
<I>As Chair of Vice, would you continue the Book of the Month?</I><br />
Malcolm: Yes, why not.<br />
Cristina: It should continue, but would rather it were delegated to someone else.<br />
<I>If the chair were to leave, could you be chair?</I><br />
Cristina: Yes.<br />
Malcolm: Yes, if I end up at Imperial.<br />
<I>Describe the ideal event you'd like to run.</i><br />
Norfolk: Exterminating the universe one being at a time.<br />
Cristina: A quiz over dinner followed by a barnight - mixing serious and fun.<br />
Malcolm: Organising a trip to the Ton to coincide with a barnight.<br />
<I>If at a barnight an older member were to hand you a pint of Golden Pride and a shot of port, would you be able to handle it?</I><br />
Malcolm: I've had worse.<br />
Cristina: Yes - I survived seven tequilas at the barnight last term.<br />
<I>Old or new traditions?</I><br />
Malcolm: Re-establish slipped traditions before we start adding new ones.<br />
Cristina: Keep the old traditions and add the new ones - not abandoning one for the other.<br />
Norfolk suggests that 'new traditions' is something of an oxymoron.<br />
<I>Old or new memes?</I><br />
Cristina: You can't control memes. They just happen.<br />
Malcolm: It is the way of memes to grow old and become cliches. As such, we always need new memes to replace old ones.<br />
Norfolk: Exterminate all the memes</P>

<P>So then, voting:<br />
<B>Round one:</B><br />
Votes to eliminate Malcolm: 0<br />
Votes to eliminate Cristina: 0<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: all of them.<br />
<B>Norfolk duly eliminated.</b><br />
Round two:<br />
Votes to eliminate Malcolm: 9<br />
Votes to eliminate Cristina: 9<br />
Chair has the deciding vote, and flips a coin to decide whom to use it for.<br />
Heads, Cristina is CoV; tails it's Malcolm.<br />
Heads it is!<br />
<B>Cristina duly elected Chair of Vice.</B><br />
<br />
</P>

<h4>Treasurer</h4>

<P>Candidates are Tim and Norfolk.</P>

<P>Tim's election speech in full: "If elected as treasurer, I intend to embezzle huge amounts of money and then flee the country." He seems to have a perfect attitude for the job.</P>

<P>Questions for the candidates: (Norfolk declined to answer any of these, this time round)<br />
<I>Do you know the current exchange rate between the US Dollar and the pound?</I> [A few wrong guesses establish that the answer is, in fact, 'no']<br />
<I>What is the VAT rate on books?</I> No idea [They're zero rated]<br />
<I>If you found treasure in the library, what would you do with it?</I> I'd hand it in to Lost and Found. Unless it turned me invisible, in which case I'd drop it in a volcano.<br />
<I>Do you know where the nearest active volcano is?</I> No [Mount Etna, Sicily]<br />
<I>If books were bought that the librarian hadn't authorised, but of which the majority of people approved, would you refund them?</I> I'd discuss with the chair and committee first.<br />
<I>Do you know how to get a VAT invoice, and what needs to be on it?</I> You get one by asking nicely for it; it needs an invoice number, date, address, some numbers... etc<br />
<I>Who is Dave Parry?</I> He's the Union Finance officer; not to be confused with Dave Clements who isn't.<br />
<I>How much does the society spend every year?</I> Of the order of £1000<br />
<I>What is the society's main source of funds?</I> Membership. In years past it has been Picocon, but not this year.<br />
<I>What is your opinion on the current membership prices?</I> They're fine, although if we move toward DVDs they may need to go up a little.<br />
<I>Last few years we've bought a lot from eBay. What's your opinion of it?</I> I don't use it myself, but I see no real problem with it.<br />
<I>What's a sensible price for a 2nd hand book or video?</I> £2 for a paperback book; more if rare or hardback. £5 for a video.<br />
<I>What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of a centralised power strucure?</I> It allows far easier communication, but when there's a coursework deadline we'll all be missing at the same time.<br />
<I>Why do you want the position of treasurer?</I> I want to do something for the society, and feel that I can manage treasurer; I don't massively want to be secretary.<br />
<I>Do you enjoy filling out forms?</I> Yes, actually. [Strange boy...]<br />
<I>What's your mother's maiden name?</I> I'm not telling you!<br />
<I>But you do know it?</I> Yes, of course.<br />
<I>What's your opinion of classic british Sci Fi?</I> I prefer Military SF.<br />
<I>Who is Number One?</I> I don't like The Prisoner, sorry.</P>

<P>Voting, again:<br />
Votes to eliminate Tim: 6<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: 12<br />
<b>Tim duly elected Treasurer.</b><br />
<br />
</P>

<h4>Secretary</h4>

<P>Candidates are Ben, Mark (hereafter referred to as Mook) and Norfolk. Once again, Norfolk is very quiet this round.</P>

<P>Ben believes he can do a better job as Secretary than as Fanzine Editor. The laughter from the assembled crowd suggests they do, too.<br />
Mook is good at talking to other mooks and getting stuff done. By 'stuff done' he means 'killed by the heroes'.</P>

<P>Questions for the candidates:<br />
<I>Do you forsee any problems with publishing the minutes on time?</I><br />
Mook: No.<br />
Ben: The only problem is getting the material; once I have it, publishing it is the easy part.<br />
<I>Can you read your own handwriting?</I><br />
Mook: After how much alcohol?<br />
Ben: Yes. Generally.<br />
<I>Do you know HTML?</I>
Mook: Not really, only very basic stuff.<br />
Ben: No.<br />
<I>As the society's Secretary, do you intend to have a scandalous relationship with another committee member?</I><br />
Ben: Is that an offer, Malcolm?<br />
Mook: I'm not having a scandalous relationship with anyone, committee or not.<br />
<I>As Secretary, how would you help next year's Picocon Sofa when Picocon comes around?</I><br />
Ben: By being a general dogsbody; I'd help with minutes and information gathering, also I'd make sure that this year's postmortem gets applied.<br />
Mook: I'd do what I was told.<br />
<I>Finally, do you intend as a secretary to wear a short skirt and low cut top?</I><br />
Mook: No!<br />
Ben: Hell yeah!</P>

<P>Given which, there was no way we could safely elect Ben. The voting:<br />
<B>Round one:</b><br />
Votes to eliminate Ben: 1<br />
Votes to eliminate Mook: 0<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: (N-1)<br />
<b>Norfolk duly eliminated.<br />
Round two:</b><br />
Votes to eliminate Ben: 11<br />
Votes to eliminate Mook: 1<br />
<B>Mook duly elected as Secretary.</B><br />
<br />
</P>

<h4>Picocon Sofa</h4>

<P>Norfolk and Ben are the candidates for this very popular position.</P>

<P>Is Ben going to make another speech? Not a big one. The difficulty in being Picocon Sofa is overcoming the stress. Ben can overcome stress with his groove. Also by delegating stuff.</P>

<P>Questions for the candidates. Norfolk appears to have gone to sleep, because he's still not answering.<br />
<I>How do you plan on getting the wargaming members of the committee to go to things like Tons?</I> Ben can pull a lot of weight with the wargamers, what with being Chair; also Picocon's not for Wargames, so they'll have to understand and play along nicely.<br />
<I>As a Picocon Sofa, how would you like to be upholstered?</I> Not in leather. Nor in white, that tends to pick up stains too easily.<br />
<I>Would you want to run a film at Picocon next year?</I> Definitely yes.<br />
<I>How are you going to deal with the problem of organising apathetic incompetent geeks?</I> As best he can; also, big sticks.<br />
<I>What's the absolute maximum on the number of authors you should have invited at once?</I> Three.<br />
<I>If there were a Director's Cut of Evil Overlord available for Picocon, would you show it?</I> Sure.<br />
<I>In a perfect world, who'd top the bill at Picocon 23?</I> Tom Holt.<br />
<I>Do you have any new ideas for Picocon?</I> Not yet, but it would be nice to start planning earlier this year, and that way hopefully some will come out in time.<br />
<I>Do you have any old ideas for Picocon?</I> Let's try to bring the film back, assuming that there's anything worth watching out at the time.<br />
<I>The film generally loses some money. Would you still want to run it anyway?</I> Yes, if it seems feasible and there's enough in the coffers to cover it. It's popular and draws some people to Picocon; it also raises the visibility of the society.<br />
<I>Will the program be ready earlier next year?</I> Oh hell yes.<br />
<I>Do you know what a fish key is?</I> It's a thing that lets you get power, isn't it?<br />
<I>Do you know where the Big Rubber Bonker comes from?</I> From the Motor Club.<br />
<I>If a William Shatner video were to find its way to you for next year, would it go in for Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise?</I> You forget, I gave it in for DoDM in the first place. So, with that in mind, hell yeah!<br />
<I>How will you ensure that there is power to all the rooms, and that the correct facilities are unlocked?</I> We'll produce a checklist early on and work through that; we'll get agreements in writing from the Union.<br />
<I>Will there be a fish duel next year?</I> Officially? No.<br />
<I>What if there were a spontaneous fish duel?</I> I wouldn't stand against it.<br />
<I>Have you looked at the Picocon Wiki?</I> Yes.<br />
<I>Who would you choose to be on your Picocon Subcommittee?</I> People with the right skills. And Mook.</P>

<P>Voting. There can be only one:<br />
Votes to eliminate Ben: 2<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: Many<br />
<B>Ben duly elected as Picocon Sofa</b><br />
<br />
</P>

<h4>Fanzine and Wyrmtongue Editor</h4>

<P>Smithers stands for this much-maligned post, although he warns us that, if elected, Wyrm will contain manga, pro-furry propaganda, and frequent rambling.</p>

<P>Questions for the candidate. Let's face it, we know Norfolk would only say 'exterminate' to every question anyway.<br />
<I>You do know that our prejudice isn't against all furries, don't you? It's just against Tai.</I> Well, that how it seemed so far.<br />
<I>How do you plan to get submissions?</I> Badger people where necessary, and put my own art in to supplement that.<br />
<I>Given how stressed you've been this year, how do you plan to survive second year physics and be able to do this job?</I> If necessary I'll recycle old art and get submissions from outside the society.<br />
<I>Which is your favourite photocopier?</I> The one in the main library is better, although the one in the MCCR is free.<br />
<I>Have you read any of the past fanzines?</i> Yes, the last three.<br />
<I>Do you know the policy on subordinate clauses?</I> No. [Neither do I, for that matter - Alex]<br />
<I>Do you know the fanzine naming convention?</i> Again, no. [I do! The editor chooses any really pretentious-sounding word they like!]<br />
<I>What will you do about objectively awful fanzine submissions? We're talking 'Eye of Argon' level badness here.</I> Won't use them unless we have absolutely nothing else.<br />
<I>Do you see yourself as an editor of other people's work, or as a creator of something new in its own right?</I> I'm definitely an editor more than a writer... so an editor, probably.</P>

<P>Voting:<br />
Votes to eliminate Smithers: 7<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: 11<br />
<b>Smithers duly elected as Fanzine/Wyrmtongue Editor.</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Publicity Officer</h4>

<P>Dave Bartram stands. He claims to be better at publicity, though perhaps less good at extermination, than Norfolk.</P>

<P>Questions. These are getting mercifully fewer, as everyone gets anxious to go to the pub.<br />
<I>Do you know the Union poster regulations?</I> No, but I'll find out.<br />
<I>How do YOU plan to survive second year physics?</I> I'll manage fine.<br />
<I>Where do you get Blu Tack?</I> Again, I'll ask my predecessor.<br />
<I>What is the use of Christian Union and His People for ICSF?</i> No idea. [Free blu tack, since most of their posters contravene Union poster regs and can thus legally be taken down and replaced with ours.]</p>

<P>Voting:<br />
Votes to eliminate Dave: 1<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: (N-1)<br />
<B>Dave duly elected as Publicity Officer.</B><br />
<br />
</P>


<h4>Web Editor</h4>

<P>The KarneMouse gestalt reluctantly stands, but would rather someone else could do it. They've been running the web site for nine years now, and would like to teach someone else so that it can go on after they leave.<br />
Malcolm stands for the position; the KarneMouse gestalt hastily withdraw.</P>

<P>Voting<br />
Votes to eliminate Malcolm: 2<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: (N-2)<br />
<B>Malcolm duly elected as Web Editor</B><br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Projectionist</h4>

<P>Shuri has never seen a projectionist do anything, and therefore considers herself amply qualified. Also, she knows the senior projectionist of ICU cinema.</P>

<P>Question to the candidate:<br />
<I>Which films do you intend to show?</I> Not the ones Dan [ICU cinema senior projectionist] wants to show.</P>

<P>Voting:<br />
Votes to eliminate Shuri: 2<br />
Votes to eliminate Norfolk: (N-2)<br />
<B>Shuri duly elected as Projectionist.</b></P>
