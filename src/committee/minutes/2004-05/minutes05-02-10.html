<h2>Minutes of ICSF Committee Meeting, 10/02/05</h2>
<p><b>Present</b> - Ali (Picocon Sofa), Ben (Wyrm/Fanzine Ed.), Malc (Treasurer), Alex (Sec.), Robbie, Tim, Duncan, Jay, Vicky, Nichola Sinclair, Levi Tidhar<br />
<b>Apologies</b> - Simon (electioneering), Kath (overwork), Jake (over-bureaucracy), the society apologises for Mital<br />
<b>awol</b> - Jakob (GJ's babysitter)<br />
<i>Meeting opened 1900</i></p>


<P>Tim not to ask Mital about his five library cards.<br />
Meeting to attempt five minutes progress w/o an in-joke.<br />
In reward, Ben not to be set on fire.<br />
The best way to do this is probably just to work through the timetable one step at a time, and see what comes up.</p>

<h3>So what's actually happening on the day?</h3>

<P><B>1000 - Doors Open, not a fish duel</b><br />
Can they film while setting up? Don't see why not.<br />
What sort of time? About 0800 onwards, realistically.</P>

<P><B>1100 - Simon's speech, Gwyneth Jones, not a fish duel</b><br />
Film the welcome speech? Sure.<br />
What ID do we need? Student card for student rates.<br />
No, we mean ID for people who've paid? Suggestions include ICSF stamp on wrist, house sticker?<br />
Houses? We'll explain that later.<br />
GJ's talk is on "Insanity". <I>Her own, or someone else's?</i><br />
What's the arrangement with authors? Do they just meet and greet? Babysitters act as chaperones throughout the day and introduce the authors' talks.</P>

<P><B>1200 - Lunch, Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise, not a fish duel</B><br />
<I>DoDM is explained: It's a charity auction, with Liquid Nitrogen and sledgehammers.</i><br />
Tim is named as the liason officer between the filming people and ICSF.<br />
Material for DoDM is discussed. At the moment it's looking a little short, so if we can get more, good.</P>

<P><B>1330 - John Courtenay Grimwood (Q&A only), not a fish duel</b><br />
What's the normal turnout for the talks? About 40-50. For some attendees, the bar is as much of a draw.<br />
Overall turnout normally ~100. Last year was exceptional, with ~150<br />
Brian Stableford is bringing some of his MA students, which may bump the numbers up a little.<br />
We'll need a "I do not wish to be filmed" option on registering for people who'd rather not be.<br />
Person doing registration at front desk to take polaroid of such a person so that they can be pixellated out later.<br />
We might need someone to do sketches in case they also refuse to have their pic taken!</P>

<P><B>1430 - Brian Stableford, not a fish duel</b></P>

<P><B>1530 - Panel, not a fish duel</B><br />
Topic is to be determined by the bookclub<br />
On a slight tangent, do we have questions for the quiz? Yes, a few, but more would be welcome, please.<br />
We should invite Rob Grant.<br />
<I>*then the conversation drifted way, way off topic. More even than normal. eg:</I><br />
	Apparently Deanna Troi lives in north London.<br />
	Ali's friend is owed a favour by Patrick Stewart.</P>

<P><B>1630 - Silly games, not a fish duel</b><br />
Just a Minute, Call my Bluff, Mornington Crescent, etc<br />
People being witty for other people's enjoyment.</P>

<P><B>1730 - </b><br />
Officially nothing is happening.<br />
On an unrelated note, sea bass are considered medium-calibre fish.<br />
On an equally unrelated note, ICSF doesn't have an official Champion. However, Cristina does fence Epee and Sabre for the university.</p>

<P><B>1800 - Quiz, not a fish duel</b></P>

<P><B>1900 - Close</B></P>

<P><B>2000 - Supper with the authors</B><br />
Despite Ali sending out an email over a week ago, we still don't even know what the authors' dietary requirements are.<br />
Nor do we know where we're going.</P>



<P>So, which traders are coming? Fantasy Centre, Porcupine Books, Playin' Games. Filming people to contact to ask permission for filming.<br />
Can you explain the thing with the houses? They're effectively teams for an ongoing competition. Last year we had Houses Harkonnen, Gryffindor, That Jack Built.<br />
Points can be earned for the houses by doing things through the day.<br />
Mostly stupid things.<br />
Last year we offered points for Tiny Tom. May do something similar this year, with the proviso that doppelg&auml;ngers aren't worth any points.<br />
Any more meetings before Picocon? Book club Monday, Committee meeting Tuesday.</P>

<P>So then. Filming people to turn up ~0800. Look for people in Psi/Phi t-shirts.<br />
Sadly there are no Picocon t-shirts this year.<br />
Ali's phone number, for those who need him, is 07708647251</P>

<h3>AOB?</h3>

<P>Treasurer's report: We have more members than last year, hurrah!</P>
