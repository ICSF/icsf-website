			<li class="action">Benedict to check the Ewok adventures
			<ul>
				<li>He has since done so, they are of much higher video quality</li>

		<li>If this is possible, Metric clearance can be done such that we finish at 6pm. This gives sellers extra time</li>

		<li>LAN last-call is also at 5ish. The machines should be about ready to go when the clean up team gets the trolley back</li>
