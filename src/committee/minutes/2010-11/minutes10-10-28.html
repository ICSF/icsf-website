	<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Gabriel makes claims to competence, is greeted with doubtful looks.</li>
		<li>Money is "fine", spending more on books is not an issue</li>
		<li>College will however cut money to the union resulting in lesser grants next year.</li>
		<li>Cameron has spoken to some union tresurer, societies will "get the money they need to operate"</li>
		<li>Do we need/should we have insurance for TV? (no, thats what contingency claims are for)</li>

	<h3>Hay-on-Wye</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Hay-on-Wye needs 100 monies in deposit before the year is over, some other group of people are trying to steal our slots</li>
		<li>When to run Hay-on-Wye? one weeks screws over bio freshers (all 0 of them) another screws over other freshers who are moving out of halls (significantly more)</li>
		<li>Who is going to drive?</li>
		<li>Bunkhouse is &pound;12 per person and night, &pound;260 minimum</li>
		<li>The limiting factor is the minivan, not the number of beds. If there are cars involved things may be different</li>
