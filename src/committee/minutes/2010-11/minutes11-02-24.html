	<h3>Apolgies</h3>
	<div class="peoples">Joakim Scharp (Secretary)</div>

	<h3>Writer's Workshop</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The workshop is on 2th and 9th March, in meeting room 2</li>
		<li>The Union website is not yet showing tickets
		<ul>
			<li>The data for this was submitted beginning of this week, the Union have fail</li>
			<li class="action">Lucy to make sure tickets are sold somehow</li>
			<li class="action">RebeccaLiz to poke people in the Union to make tickets appear, and find our missing sales receipts</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h3>Picocon</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Picocon Happened.</li>
		<li>It appeared to go quite well.</li>
	</ul>

<p>These minutes make use of data in the <a href="postmortem-briefing.pdf">Unofficial briefing package</a> (400KB PDF)</p>

	<h3>Picocon Attendance</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Attendance Figures are up on last year</li>
		<li>This, however, is partly due to Benedict getting all the stallholders etc. to register as free entrants</li>
		<li>Other SciFi societies were done on last year
		<ul>
			<li>Almost a decrease of 30%</li>
			<li>League of non-Aligned didn't take advantage of the offer, need to make sure they know to explain who they are</li>
			<li>IFIS (Royal Holloway) now have Picocon listed as an annual event.</li>
			<li>Middlesex had a suprising number of attendees - might be worth contacting them in advance next year</li>
			<li>Kings attendance is possibly still tied to Tai</li>
			<li>Kings, UCL, Cambridge, and OUSFG failed to reply usefully to RebeccaLiz</li>
			<li>We should do more than just email the societies - attend their events with flyers?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Picocon Temporal Location</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Due to communication issues, publicity was behind at a variety of times</li>
		<li>We need to send the date out to the Picocon mailing list earlier
		<ul>
			<li>Yes. We have a picocon mailing list</li>
			<li>Sending out the initial email was delayed due to setting it up</li>
			<li>This did not <em>seem</em> to adversly affect attendance too much</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The Authors and Date should be sent out early in the academic year</li>
		<li>The only clash this year was with a LARP event</li>
		<li>Holding it in the usual weekend would have meant clashing with Redemption</li>
		<li>Redemption is bi-annual, so this is not a concern for next year</li>
		<li class="action">Wouter (ViceChair) to publicise and organise trip to EasterCon</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>T-Shirts</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>T-Shirts were sold.</li>
		<li>They are yet to make a profit <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">(Well, it dpeends whose numbers you use. In the end, we agreed that we had broken even, and had plenty more to sell)</span></li>
		<li>They weren't being flogged before the event that much</li>
		<li>During the day, there wasn't that much uptake</li>
		<li>Many people didn't spot the stall in Metric</li>
		<li>The stall in LT1 foyer was a very good idea</li>
		<li>We need to get the art in earlier</li>
		<li>Get the sofa to pick a theme before summer, start getting art then</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>T-Shirts (Non Picocon)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>It was suggested that we should do generic SciFi t-shirts</li>
		<li>There was a positive response to this idea</li>
		<li>There is also room for mugs and other such tings</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Metric</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What was once dB's is now Metric, which is very much a nightclub</li>
		<li>Dear god, the lights. They do not burn!</li>
		<li>Most parties have complained about the lighting</li>
		<li>We also couldn't open the doors</li>
		<li>These things should be checked and neigotiated before next year</li>
		<li class="action">Cameron to find outt how much money the bar made (for future use in convincing them)</li>
		<li>The quiz lacked room. There are options:
		<ul>
			<li>Try to get permission to use 568. We should all fit in there
			<ul>
				<li>Can't be formally booked</li>
				<li>There are other quizzes in there</li>
				<li>Sweet tlaking them shoudl be easy</li>
				<li>The quiz can (and should be) open to all</li>
				<li>May be able to get a PA system</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Use a bit of 568 and also use the Union Bar
			<ul>
				<li>Gauruntees the space</li>
				<li>Requires too callers</li>
				<li>Peter was slowly dying from calling</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Do it in Union Acitvity Space 1
			<ul>
				<li>Buying a keg would be against our bar spend, as it a bit close call on profit (80 pints for &pound;130, we can undercut the main bar. People are concerned)</li>
				<li>Not having alcohol readily available will turn people off from the Quiz</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>There's was no setup plan for metric before the day
		<ul>
			<li>This was fine - there were plenty of helpers, and we were more adaptive that way</li>
		</ul>
		<li>There was a need for more, bigger, better, harder, faster signs</li>
		<li>Common signs should be added to the wiki</li>
		<li class="action">Benedict to make signs be on the wiki</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Registration Forms</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The registration forms were confusing to some people</li>
		<li>They also left a lot of people milling around finding pens and space to fill them out</li>
		<li>Pre-sending forms to SF groups would speed their entry</li>
		<li>Having pre-registration (if not pre-pay) would speed things up considerably
		<ul>
			<li>It also saves the desk monkeys a lot of time in collating family fortunes information, etc. etc.</li>
			<li class="action">Benedict to make it so</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Baby Sitters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Introductions didn't happen
		<ul>
			<li>This was mainly due to a fun combination of people losing voices, running around busy, and other factors that disreupted the plans</li>
			<li>The babysitter's instruction package shoudl include instrcutions to prepare introductions</li>
			<li>The actual reading will probably be done by the LT1 ringmaster</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>RAG Events</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"Smashy Smashy"</li>
		<li>Amount raised was down this year (only 286.33)
		<ul>
			<li>Fewer syndicates were formed</li>
			<li>The Owain/Peter wars were out of scope</li>
			<li>Certan turkey reading items were in a sense worthwhile
			<ul>
				<li>Needs things that don't end in a desirable state - good bit in the middle, worse either side</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Peter and Chris' attmepts to encourage at the turkey readings was a bit obvious
			<ul>
				<li>"Fix Better!"</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Steve was missed :(</li>
			<li>Rosannah's reading was excellent, despite some peoepl's doubts</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The amount of hamming up was greatly disagreed upon. Some people think more, some less</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Silly Games</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="action">Benedict to slap MAakr upside of the head for excessive trolling</li>
		<li>THere was a large starting lag, which discouraged people. This was due to a lack partcipants being in the right place at the right time.</li>
		<li>Babysitters must test the waters for authors doing silly games and, if the author is willing, make sure they're at the right place at the right time</li>
		<li>Having a list of people prepped, including some reserves, would also help.</li>
		<li>Dave Clemence 'rescued' Just A Minute</li>
		<li>Mornington crescent was "not a meh as I usually find it" (Peter Mabbott), but some members of the panel have to know when to finish</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Snor Lax</h3>
	<ul>

		<li>Lax laxlax lax 3 snor lax lax lax lax. Lax lax 3 snor</li>
		<li>Moxon's is an awesome fishmonger which can meet all of our needs</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Clean Up</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The clean up went well</li>
		<li>Let's try ot not lose the ladder next time, though</li>
		<li>Aside form the banner, clean out of booked rooms was finished before 6pm, albeit by only 2 minutes</li>
		<li>Bags, books, etc. which are despoited with the desk or in the library sohudl be clearly labelled with a name</l>
	</ul>

	<h3>Gaming</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The LAN being upsaitrs significantly reduced the range of ppeople playing it - no passing by traffic</li>
		<li>Projector Games never turned up</li>
		<li>The board gamers were badly effected by the lack of light in metric.</li>
		<li>The Magic group were most unhelpful. They avoided wrath by setting up in 568, and not actually joining the convention (possibly - this is unconfirmed).
		<ul>
			<li>They also played in a format unlikely to attract beginners</li>
			<li>Really, it's their loss - no extra members from our ranks</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>All gaming should probably be grouped in one (well sign-posted) game space for attracting more people</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Publicity</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>More posters, earlier. saturate</li>
		<li>Flyers were good. Take more to the SciFi meets</li>
		<li>There needs to be better communciation between the publicity officer and the picocon sofa</li>
		<li>Poster Rage will get us nowhere. The five minutes of arguing about how to deal with it can be summed up as:
		<ul>
			<li>Deal with it</li>
			<li>Put up more posters, or remove convering ones</li>
			<li class="action">Wouter to make explosive paper</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Some lovely people wanted to advertise for us. Have pre-made pubicity packs, that include a few posters, some flyers, and any outher useful resources pre-made</li>
		<li>"Publicity, Puclicity, Publicity, Publicity"</li>
		<li>Start it in November, or become unto the fail whale.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Quix</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The quiz seemed reasonably well balanced</li>
		<li>We needed more answer sheets</li>
		<li>There was aomse negative response to Anime and Computer Game rounds</li>
		<li>The 'themed' rounds idea was on the hole very good</li>
		<li>One question was overly long, and almost took the life of Peter</li>
		<li>The quiz was about the right length at 60 questions</li>
		<li>Picture orunds keep getting spoilt by the authors</li>
		<li>Future round ideas:
		<ul>
			<li>Composite Face Image</li>
			<li>'First' frame form a film</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The quiz needs to be started earlier</li>
		<li>No, really, it does</li>
		<li class="action">Cameron to star writing next years quiz</li>
		<li>Spare question could be put somehwere for safe keeping. Possibly the wiki. Or somewhere where they ocudl go into a digital ballot box, so not everyone can go look at them</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Meal</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Wagamamas was good</li>
		<li>The secondary meal was also a good idea</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Other Details / Business</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"We should do a black tie event!"</li>
		<li class="action">Lucy to organise such a thing</li>

		<li>Sheffield Matt was on the desk, or on the LAN all day. Kudos to him</li>
<span class="entrance">[19:37] Lucy McGregor (Librarian) returns</span>
		<li>Lucy's Mother judges us for still being in this meeting</li>
		<li>The scavenger hunt wass "full of lame physics jokes", according to some people</li>
		<li>The command structure needs to be better implemented, and more obvious
		<ul>
			<li>Just t-shirts too cold in Feb</li>
			<li>Old sahses weren't that great</li>
			<li>Newer, better sashes are required</li>
			<li>The stall holders could do with a dedicated baby sitter</li>
			<li>People, when confronted with other people asking questions (beyond 'where is x?' etc.) should send the asker up the chain unless they are certain of the answer</li>
		</ul</li>
		<li>Securtiy were unaware of the event's existence
		<ul>
			<li>This was due to problems in their information protocols</li>
			<li>The data was confirmed reasonably quickly on the day, once they realised there was an event</li>

		<li>Parking suffered similar issues</li>
		<li>Metric was double booked form 4:30 to 6:))</li>
