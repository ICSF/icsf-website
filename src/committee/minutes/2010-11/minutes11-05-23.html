		<li>An alternate theme is non-humanoid aliens</li>
	</ul>
<span class="entrance">[18:09] Patrick Boyle enters</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Theme leads to three apocalypses / predictors as houses</li>
		<li>Potential panel question: "Apocalypse - How?"</li>
		<li class="action">RebeccaLiz to email Wouter author invitation template (also to wiki...)</li>
	</ul>
<span class="entrance">[18:11] Unknown Member enters</span>
<ul>
		<li class="action">Wouter to email list of author ideas</li>
		<li>We're intended to prefer 'better' authors to theme fitting, where we can</li>
		<li>The names Richard Morgan, Charles Stross, and Peter K Hamilton were all mentioned</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Formal Dinner</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Here there are primarily two options: in Union, or elsewhere</li>
		<li>Have been in touch with Beit conferencing - &pound;25 / person + charges = ~&pound;30pp</li>
		<li>Outside likely to be a little more</li>
		<li>Probably best to put it on a Saturday evening in order to allow alumni time to travel</li>
		<li>However, should be in term time in order to get current members</li>
		<li>There are few opportunities left before the end of term, and exams are everywhere</li>
		<li>It should probably be done sometime near the beginning of autumn term</li>
		<li>Possibly before freshers, possibly a few weeks in</li>
		<li class="action">Lucy to send out sample menu for comparison point</li>
		<li>Feeling is onwards next term, not union (no formal vote)</li>
	</ul>
<span class="exit">[18:16] Joakin Scharp exits</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Union is to be used as a benchmark for rating places</li>
		<li>Going outside the union will make it easier to organise for alumni and other non-union members</li>
		<li>Lucy wants all of sci-fi to look <strong><em>gorgeous</em></strong></li>
		<li>We'll be looking to book for around 50 (lots of interested alumni and +1s)</li>
		<li>With this number in mind, not union is pressed a lot more</li>
		<li>Must be careful not to make freshers feel excluded</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Hay-on-Wye</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Members of the committee and others present are asked to be calm</li>
		<li>Unsubsidised, it costs approximately slightly under &pound;35 per person</li>
		<li>Wouter would like to subsidise it to &pound;25 per person</li>
		<li>This is estimated to be about &pound;8 a person, and is not likely to exceed &pound;12</li>
		<li>It is noted that the price to the members may have to rise from &pound;25 next year</li>
		<li class="passed">To make this subsidy (2 abstentions, 0 against)</li>
		<li>We have been offered the use of a car by Alex 'Fluffy' Savell</li>
		<li>He would like us to pay the &pound;40 insurance for the week
			<ul>
				<li>It would only be used for Hay in this time</li>
				<li>This is less than the amount expected to rent one as researched by Peter</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>We have never had an issue with filling seats</li>
		<li>We would still have John Davenport and Peter Mabbott to drive the minibus</li>
		<li>We do have possible upcoming drivers</li>
		<li>Using a car with 5 people may push us over the minimum people-days</li>
		<li class="passed">To pay for the insurance (5 abstentions, 0 against)</li>
		<li>Some seats will remain pre-allocated
			<ul>
				<li>Drivers</li>
				<li>The Chair of Vice</li>

				<li>Librarian Elect</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If online ticketing gives issuing, we...???</li>
		<li>We are not hiring Peter a prostitute</li>
		<li>Fluffy has a choice of car-mates, where possible</li>
