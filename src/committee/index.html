		<p>
			The committee form the core of the society, and are as close to in
			charge of the society as anyone can be; they have meetings, approve
			budgets, and generally try and make sure things happen.
			Liberating Daleks, cuddling plushie great old ones, and wearing scary
			t-shirts are all optional, but fun, pastimes of committee.
		</p>

		<h2>The Committee</h2>

		<div class="columns">

		<div class="no-break"><h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Chair Entity: Rebecca Allday
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsflib@gmail.com">icsflib@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			The buck stops here. Responsible for overseeing everything that's
			happening, and doing it themselves if all else fails, which it
			usually does.
			The Chair also has to attend SCC meetings, be aware of what the
			Treasurer and the Librarian are doing and delegate lots.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Chair of Vice: vacant
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsf.chairofvice@gmail.com">icsf.chairofvice@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Keeping the populace from rebelling against the committee by the
			regular organisation of bar nights is the primary purpose of the
			Chair of Vice, a long with any other events - such as the annual
			trip to Hay-on-Wye, and cinema outings as things come out.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Secretary: Sophie Appleyard
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsf.secretary@gmail.com">icsf.secretary@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Responsible for taking, writing up, and occasionally editing
			minutes of meetings. Also for bothering the email list and
			maintaining the key list. Sound easy? T'ain't.
			For reasons unknown, they generally end up the only committee
			member who knows what's happening and spend their time trying to
			keep the rest of the committee on task.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Treasurer: Luke Conmy
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsftreasurers@gmail.com">icsftreasurers@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Deals with the cash, turns up to meetings and hopefully makes
			calming noises along lines of "we have lots of money, don't worry".
			An indispensable post, which sounds a lot easier than it is.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Librarian: Tobias Cook
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsf.librarian@gmail.com">icsf.librarian@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			The librarian is responsible for the library and its bounteous contents.
			Duties includes keeping the database up to date, organising book buys,
			chasing bad people with overdue items!
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Picocon Sofa: vacant
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsf.picoconsofa@gmail.com">icsf.picoconsofa@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Picocon is our annual one-day convention, which tends to be
			stupendous fun for everyone attending, and horribly stressful for
			the organisers.
			The Sofa chairs the Picocon sub-committee, and must manage all
			aspects of Picocon, whilst being directly responsible for all
			external contacts. They also get a Union tankard for their trouble.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Picocon Beanbag: vacant</h3>
		<p>
			The vice-chair of the Picocon committee, the Picocon Beanbag is
			responsible for the arrangement for Picocon that are internal to
			the college.
			This generally involves beating off other societies that want the
			rooms we use with a metaphorical stick, whilst waiting to be
			elevated to Picocon Sofa for next year.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Editor: Ryo Kuno
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsfwyrmtongue@gmail.com">icsfwyrmtongue@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Produces and distributes the society's "bi-monthly" newsletter,
			Wyrmtongue, and the annual Fanzine. Lives in continual hope of
			finding a keen fresher to hive Wyrmtongue off to.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Publicity Officer: vacant
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsfpublicityofficer@gmail.com">icsfpublicityofficer@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			Designs, prints and puts up the posters, and talks to
			societies/entities outside of Imperial.
			Also responsible for social media output (Twitter; Instagram) and
			acquiring as much blu-tac as possible.
			Gets grumbled at if no-one turns up to events.
		</p></div>

		<div class="no-break"><h3>Tech Priest: Anand Doshi
		(<span class="sans"><a href="mailto:icsf.techpriest@gmail.com">icsf.techpriest@gmail.com</a></span>)</h3>
		<p>
			The tech-priest is responsible for the upkeep of all hardware and
			software in use by the society. This includes this website, the
			library computers &amp; database, and the library's audio/visual stack.
		</p></div>
		</div>

		<h2 id="constitution">Committee Duties</h2>

		<p>
			The committee doesn't just get to do what they want (quite).
			There are a number of documents that define what both the committee
			and the members are expected to do, what they're allowed to do,
			and what they can do to each other when they start failing.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the most parts, these can be ignored by anyone with a
			bureaucracy level of higher than 34.
