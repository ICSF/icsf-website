			<strong>In person events may not happen anytime soon, but we are still active! Join our
 			Discord server to chat about all the stuff we usually chat about (in text channels 24/7 and
			in voice channels on Wednesdays), games nights on Fridays, and any other events we (or you)
			can think about!</strong>

			ICSF is the centre for science fiction, fantasy and horror fans at
			Imperial College. We run a library of over 9000 books and 1800 DVDs
			and videos from all corners of the genre. Whether your interest is
			Pratchett's <i>Discworld</i>, <i>The Sandman</i> graphic novels, or
			<i>Stargate</i>, this is an ideal way to indulge it! It's a great
			place to pick up new and exciting obsessions too!
		</p>
		<p>
			The social side of the society is equally active &ndash; the
			<a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/library/">library</a> is open every
			lunchtime on weekdays and we have regular video showings
			(often weird or esoteric stuff you should have seen but won't
			have). Film night are on Fridays, and we have large themed events
			for Halloween and Christmas.
			We also run events like mass outings to the cinema and end
			of term dinners; you can see what is coming up on the
			<a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/events/">events page</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The
			largest event of the year is <a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/picocon/">Picocon</a>,
			our one-day convention held in February, which usually attracts around 200 attendees.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all, being
			a member is a lot of fun and a great way to make new friends who are
			interested in SF or fantasy.
			Interested?  We can be found in our purpose built library in the
			West Wing Basement of Beit Quad (the Students Union building),
			opposite IC Radio. Click for <a
			href="<!--SRVROOT-->/library/getting-to.html">directions to the library</a>.
