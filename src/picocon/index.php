			Picocon 30 will be held on Saturday 16th February 2013,
			in Imperial College Union.
		</p>

		<h2>What is Picocon?</h2>
		<p>
			Picocon is the annual one-day Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy convention
			run by the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, ICSF.
			It usually takes place on a Saturday in February, in Imperial
			College's Student Union.
			We try not to clash with other conventions around the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a small (hence the name), affordable and convenient convention
			for students and fans in or near London.
			Registration opens at 10am, with the first scheduled events kicking
			off at around 10:30.
			The schedule concludes in the evening.
		</p>
		<p>
			At a Picocon you will encounter:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Guests of Honour doing talks and panels</li>
			<li>The Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise, typically using liquid nitrogen and an enormous hammer. (You're welcome to bring along donations!)</li>
			<li>Multiplayer LAN gaming</li>
			<li>Stalls selling books, ICSF t-shirts, and other stuff</li>
			<li>Quiz and silly games</li>
			<li>Student Union bar</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="directions">Directions to Picocon</h2>
		<p>
			Here's a general <a href="http://g.co/maps/7ahv7">map of the area</a>,
			pointing at the entrance to Beit Quad (which houses the
			Union) off Prince Consort Road.

				<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">By London Underground</h3>
				<p>
					The tube is probably easiest way to get to Picocon; both
					Gloucester Road Station and South Kensington Station are
					within easy reach.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both stations are served by the
					<span class="tube-line" style="background-color: rgba(255,209,0,0.5);">Circle</span>,
					<span class="tube-line" style="background-color: rgba(0, 114, 41, 0.5);">District</span>, and
					<span class="tube-line" style="background-color: rgba(0, 25, 168, 0.5);">Piccadilly</span>
					lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					These maps show the routes we suggest from both
					<a href="http://g.co/maps/ne7kr">Gloucester Road Station</a>
					and from
					<a href="http://g.co/maps/akrjw">South Kensington Station</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					N.B.
					Most London tube closures are scheduled at weekends.
					We will provide information on planned closures here once
					it is available from Transport for London.

				<h3>By Public Bus</h3>
				<p>
					Both the
					<a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/pdf/royalalberthall-12445.pdf">Royal Albert Hall</a>
					and the
					<a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/pdf/southkensington-2236.pdf">South Kensington</a>
					bus stop groups are near by - the Royal Albert Hall itself
					is <em>literally</em> next door to the Union.
					From South Kensington stops, follow the route map from
					<a href="http://g.co/maps/akrjw">South Kensington Station</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					These stop are served by buses
					C1, 9, 10, 49, 52, 70, 74,
					345, 360, 414, 430, and 452.
				</p>

				<h3>By &lsquo;Boris&rsquo; Bike</h3>
				<p>
					There are three hire cycle docking stations on Prince
					Consort Road, which also houses the Union.
					Search for 'SW7 2BB' on the

			<b>Important Advice:</b> If you get lost around South
			Kensington trying to find Beit Quad, ask for directions to the
			Royal Albert Hall, and once there, Beit Quad is the building
			on the left of the RAH as you face it's main entrance
			(if you arrive form the Hyde Park side, you will be at the
			rear of the RAH).
