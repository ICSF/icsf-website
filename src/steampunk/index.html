		<h2>The Imperial Steampunk Society</h2>
		<p>
			Founded in late 2013, the steampunk society once catered to Imperial's large community of tea drinking, top hat wearing goggle aficionados; otherwise known as steampunks.
			We organised trips, socials and other events; and aim to provide a meeting point for anyone with an interest in the subculture. It is now discontinued. If you found your way here, it's a dead link! Blame the techpriest (techpriest@icsf.org.uk).

		<h3>Contacting Steampunk</h3>

		<h3>Steampunk Resources</h3>
		<p>
			Apart from the society itself, the internet has a few good resources for those interested in the subculture. Chief among these is <a href="http://brassgoggles.co.uk/forum/">Brass Goggles</a>, a large and friendly forum frequented by several Society members. For those looking to join other IRL groups, there is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/139909556032928/"> British Steampunk Community</a> Facebook group, and the <a href="http://www.britishsteampunk.org/">Victorian Steampunk Society</a> (organisers of The Asylum, the UK's biggest Steampunk event) maintain a website. Finally, the Society maintains good relations with Southampton University's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/184948814914233/?fref=ts"> Krakensoc</a>, and regularly runs joint events with them.
